The waffle fries are a bit dry so you will need some condiments on the side. They have a variety of drinks which all are pretty delicious. I love there spicy chicken sandwich. I would recommend more people to come.

I was highly disappointed just coming from there now, for they had a deal with eventbrite to purchase $1 Grilled Chicken Club. I had signed up for the event with eventbrite to go today for the exclusive deal. Upon going and expecting to purchase the chicken club for again what was said to be a $1 I was told they didn't have any more. That East first frustration here. After being told there weren't any left, one of the lady's making the sandwiches asked if I wanted to supplement the grilled chicken club for something else. I replied sure and requested a spicy deluxe sandwich instead for the deal. I was given the sandwich, then in going to pay what I expected to be a $1 for the supplement sandwich that I got instead, I was told by the lady at the register that they don't take gift cards or deal codes, when what I had in my hand was the specific deal with the address for the eventbrite deal. I ended up paying full price for the sandwich and left completely pissed off. I may even go as far as to contacting Chick-Fil-A itself to discuss this because the whole ordeal was very mishandled and unprofessional. Will no longer go to this Chick-Fil-A location!"

I live at 5 University Place, and all it takes to get here is going down the elevator and walking 10 seconds. I understand most people don't have that luxury, so it won't be part of my review. But other than that, this place is just a fast food restaurant. Lines move fast, but are also long.The reason why I cannot recommend this place is out of the 10 times I've eaten here. The food has made my stomach ache maybe 3 times. I don't think it's okay to have any restaurant where there's 1/3 chance of being sick from your meal. I've had better chick-fil a, I've had better chicken, and I've had better experiences. 2/5"

Of course, by the time they arrived, they were no longer hot nor crunchy, but that's to be expected. They were a bit too salty, but the chicken was pretty moist and not dried out. It was enjoyable, but quite average."

And the sauce! Oh the Chick-fil-A sauce is soooo good! You gotta try it.It's self service so you pay as you're exiting the food area...like a typical college cafeteria. You can also pay with NYU campus cash.Plenty of places to sit but it can get extremely crowded at lunch time when NYU students are out of class.

Located in a place, not many people know since it's inside an NYU residence hall. Heads up to people who are not NYU students, it is open to the public, you just need to get it through a small door right beside the main entrance of Weinstein. Apparently, you have a lot of crazy things inside there which I discovered a year later.A bad thing about this place is that most of the food is like a take out order, so the food is made and kept for a while. Alas, fries don't feel like fries anymore. But still worth the money as you save the travel till Times Square."

19,/biz/chick-fil-a-new-york?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,New York,3 star rating,3/21/2016,This place was too hyped up in my opinion. The fried chicken were soggy and the fries were tasteless. It was an alright experience overall. But a good choice for a quick bite but would not come all the way to just eat it nor wait in line for it. 3 star in my book.

However, this won't be the first Chick-fil-a operation in the city. Deep inside an NYU building lies an express counterpart, and I've been going for years to fulfill my deepest chicken sandwich cravings.Yes, their menu offering is very limited. They only have the original sandwich, nuggets, and waffle fries, but hey, that's more than enough to make me happy. And when compared to other lunch options in the area, you can get two sandwiches and still spend less than normal.A couple insider tips: walk in with confidence. NYU students can easily sense fear, and you want to blend in as much as possible. If there's a long line of people not moving, it's most likely because they're waiting for fries. Feel free to bypass and grab a sandwich from the dispensing station. Use a red tray to carry your food, and make sure you get into a line that takes payment aside from NYU dining dollars. I've usually never had a problem, but sometimes they can switch it up on you. Oh, and stock up on sauces. Ketchup is actually located after checkout, so don't ask for it at the counter.Eat more chickin!"

For that reason, I just don't have chicken when I'm out .I am always disappointed. Chick-Fil-A is GREAT! I honestly can't get over how GOOD the chicken is. MUCH better than my own and a MILLION times better than KFC or any other place that sells cooked chicken.

The menu is extremely limited offering sandwiches, nuggets and waffle fries and they recently started offering the nugget trays up to a 200 count! This will suffice and alleviate a drive to NJ just to indulge in some real chicken nuggets and not the sub par offered at McD or Wendys."

I just feel really bad for anyone who is coming from the outside and has to eat in the high school cafeteria with no windows.Yes, you do not have to be an NYU student to get in. Just walk through the freshman dorm entrance, which is a bit awkward. As for the food:I got the grilled chicken sandwich which was excellent. The lettuce and tomatoes were extremely fresh and the chicken was made perfectly.I also got a side of fries which could have been a little more crispy which I am used to but they were still OK.They people behind the counter were super stingy with their sauce and would not give me more than one when I went back for a second and third time. I NEED multiple honey roasted mustard sauce packets & secret sauce! the guy behind the counter just did not understand. Anyways, I am still glad that there is a Chik-Fil-A and I still did my Chik-Fil-A happy dance in my seat. The one in Paramus is MUCH better if you ever get a chance to go!"
32,/biz/chick-fil-a-new-york?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,New York,5 star rating,2/18/2015,I've been a long time fan of chick fil a. It was my first job. I once drove an hour and a half to my closest location and go their iconic samdwich and fries which I ate immediately. But to make that drive worth it I bought myself a 250 nugget party platter. A party it truly was.Anyway I moved to New York in November and I crave it with a fierceness. I thought they were only in jersey but I stumbled upon this on Google maps. But before I go down to NYU (i live in the Bronx) I want to make sure you DO NOT have to be a student. That would truly break my heart. Can anyone tell me some good news. Please and thank you

34,/biz/chick-fil-a-new-york?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,New York,4 star rating,2/1/2015,"The gift and the curse, the Chick-fil-A Express at NYU. When choosing a school to further my education and give a ridiculous amount of money to I did a search on Google Maps. That search was for a Chick-fil-A. (gasp) The Universe has spoken! What a gift! Not only does NYU have a Chick-fil-A, but the only one within the five boroughs. Good ol southern fried chicken from Jawja (Georgia)! They didn't invent the chicken, just the chicken sandwich. So, with NYU having a Chick-fil-A on campus, we all know the story after that. Hey, apparently I have good company that thinks like me. content.usatoday.com/com…The curse, this is only an express location.I can get my ridiculously priced 12 piece nuggets, but not 4 piece strips. They always run out of Chick-fil-A sauce, my first preference for dunking my nuggets in. It's a combination of honey mustard, barbecue and ranch sauce. Yeah I could just mix them all myself, but Chick-fil-A fiqured out the perfect ratio mix. Dear management, please start ordering more of your namesake sauce. It consistently runs out quicker than the others. For those who will inevitably not be able to secure some Chick-fil-A sauce, Polynesian would be my second choice. Moving on...I can't get my Chick-fil-A Breakfast Platter:  scrambled eggs, a breakfast portion of their famous boneless breast of chicken, a freshly baked buttermilk biscuit and white pepper gravy with sausage. Do you know how difficult, yet awesome at the same time, to use your one biscuit as a egg and chicken biscuit, a strawberry jam biscuit and honey biscuit all at the same time?! Then to make an already insanely good breakfast platter even better, I've gotten a side of grits before at certain locations in SC. Okay I need a moment to get myself together.My third problem with this express location.... They don't have shakes! Still till this day, I haven't had a better shake than Chick-fil-A's Cookie Cream Shake! ...hold the whip cream, but still put the cherry on the top please. Thanks! BTW, this is from a person whose first job was at Sonic, America's Drive In.So with all that said... Yeah, I'll be back at Chick-fil-A getting a 12-piece nugget with some Chick-fil-A sauce between classes soon. One more good, you too can go grab a bite of southern greatness. No NYU ID is required to go access your chicken and waffle fries. Nuggets, sandwiches, and salads are available along with a dinner mint."

I don't know if I've ever experienced disappointment such as I did biting into a nugget at NYU's dining hall ""chick fila"". Any high ratings likely belong to an individual that has never visited a real restaurant.  the chicken wasn't anywhere near to the caliber of chick fila's juicy, tender, and crispy deliciousness. it was dry and chewy. blegh. i don't even think they fried the meat with the company's signature peanut oil. the fries were soggy and cold.a tear ran down my face as I chucked my food, half-finished, into the first trashcan I could find outside the dining hall. it seems we'll have to wait until they decide to open a legitimate establishment in NYC, for this place is a fraud."

This place gets hyped for being the only one in the city, but it'd be better off it there just weren't any here at all. Chick Fil-A's food is good. This is the antithesis of that. This is the Chinese knock off version of that. The fries are alright, but everything else sucks. The sandwiches are dry, and don't even remotely resemble the real deal. The nuggets are also dry, and not crunchy at all. The salads...why would you get a salad from here? I'd rather eat at downstein."

My fries were dry and not hot. My chick fil a sandwich was a good temp and it was crispy. But it lacked a sheen that I've seen in most places when I've eaten in the south. I wonder if they use peanut oil like the rest of the chick fil as do. But it didn't taste like it. It was better than no chick fil a but definitely wasn't up to par

The place was actually in the NYU cafeteria but anyone could go in and buy the food there. I had the 8 piece nuggets and the chicken sandwich. The breading on both tasted almost like the seasoning and breading from KFC. Both were made from real breast meat and not really processed like. It was a bit more salty that I would like but overall I liked it. The waffle fries were nice were fresh and crispy. Shout out to the lady at the cashier that was really friendly.

It will be crowded, the line will be unforgiving (there are only two if not one cashiers) and good luck having a tray. Not to mention that the sandwiches, nuggets and especially waffle fries are being constantly grabbed; there have been lines literally waiting for waffle fries.I always personally grab condiments when I get my chicken sandwich, fries and 16 oz. fountain drink. There are your Chic Fil-A condiments, like dressings, mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise and honey at the station, and then there are also Newman's Own dressings at the salad bar in the center behind the Chic Fil-A station, and salt, pepper and Heinz ketchup in the dining area after the cashier. It's a big deal for me. Yesterday, I put Bleu cheese dressing, mustard and ketchup over my chicken sandwich and tossed my fries in just Bleu. It was blissful, sinfully so! The creamy thick liquids coupled with that warm fried white meat and those hot and salted potato waffle fries coated in some high-sodium flavor. Really it's these moments that my mind has thrown such cautionary words away and instead put my tongue and teeth up front to make me enjoy myself.

Now I'm not saying that this particular chick fil-a has been using a mammals' feces in their spicy chicken sandwich . . . because unfortunately, they have no spicy chicken sandwiches. Strike 1 . . . let's continue.Located in the food court of University Place, the appearance of this chick fil-a looks as dreary as the people working there. Most of them were kind of just standing there and spacing out and for the ones who weren't staring at the wall, they were awkwardly staring as we looked at the limited options available to us. I've never felt more tension at a fast food establishment asking for sauce. Sure, I asked for 4 different ones but I can't help that chick fil-a makes such a wide array of delicious sauces. Anyway, I ordered a chicken sandwich, 8 pieces of chicken tenders, and some waffle fries. I will say the waffle fries were delicious but that's because I asked for fresh ones and had to wait 15 minutes for them. The chicken sandwich was okay at best but definitely on the dry side while the chicken tenders were beyond dry; even generous dousings of chick fil-a and polynesian sauce couldn't provide adequate hydration. I did initially enjoy the meal when i was still having chick fil-a hunger pains but as the dryness started to sober me up, I realized that this chick fil-a is sadly under-performing. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't horrible or anything but coupled with some pretty lackluster service and an overall general feeling of desertion, I have to say that i'll only be visiting when my cravings for chick fil-a are causing unbearable pain."

The pickle added a little something different, that screams, ""we are not your average chicken chain."" The waffle cut fries, are light, flavorful, but nicely done, and just brings together the entire meal.  The scene is, it's basically in a brightly lit, cafeteria, located in one of the dorms. You go in, make a hard right, and there it is. The cafeteria is rather large and adequate so you can eat there, or bag your meal yourself to go. The bags are located by the register, to the far right hand side of the cafeteria.  The chicken sandwiches, nuggets, and fries are all under a heat lamp, so you basically grab, and go. You can't be too picky because after all you are an outsider infiltrating NYU's territory here. Observe the students, and execute your order is my best advice to you, if you're patronizing for the first time.

Unfortunately this place loses a couple of stars because you aren't given a choice.   All the chicken meat is ground into patties, nuggets and strips and doesn't resemble how it was born.  It's as though they abandoned God's plan and re-worked the chicken to conform to their value (meal) system.

I've just never had the desire to have my meat between buns.  But, ""try everything once"" I say.  At Chick Fil-A they use a little bit of peanut oil and some butter to help lubricate things.  And don't be surprised to find they've also snuck a pickle in your buns as well.The manager suggested we come back for breakfast sometime and try his sausage.Jenn said maybe... if she can chow on a muffin.  We'll see."

They also pride themselves on their waffle fries, lemonade, their service, and fact that they're a Christian business who remains closed on Sundays (something unheard of for a successful chain). Their only location this far north is a tiny express window with a limited menu inside of one of NYU's dining halls. There is no sign outside and no indication that there is a Chik-Fil-A hiding inside because it's not really meant for the public BUT the general public are allowed in the dining hall (I asked). You'll feel like you're sneaking back to college which is fun, don't worry about seeming old because I saw some NYU professors and older students here too. I got a grilled chicken sandwich which was tasty but not nearly as fresh, plump, or cheap as a proper Chik-Fil-A location. The service was also pretty off.

Let's explore why.This Chick-Fil-A is actually part of NYU's campus and is in a dorm food court next to Quiznos and some other fastfood stores. It's an express version, so basically there are much fewer items, the chicken sandwich, salad, chicken nuggets, and waffle fries. The hot items are made and placed under a heat lamp. Come during lunch time, hope that chick-fil-a's is going well and that they're cooking consistently.For the food, assuming you're lucky enough to get it fresh, you've hit gold. I had a chicken sandwich that was somewhere in between fresh and cold, so I didn't have it too bad. And it tasted reasonably well for fastfood and the sauces help a lot.More than anything else though, their waffle fries are amazing. I loved it. There's not too many places I've had waffle fries from, but this surely tops anything else I've had. I don't know the technicalities of purchasing if you're not a NYU student.

I went around and there was a group of employees from Chik Fil-A giving out chicken sandwiches, cow pez dispensers and a cow plush! I asked my co-workers and they're like ""it's free...no question about that"" but still I wanted to know why out of the ordinary these people came to our office. Turns out Chik Fil-A was mentioned in one of our products, so it's a yearly surprise that they would show up at the office and give us free food and toys! The chicken sandwich is really good! It's not dry like other chicken sandwiches where you take a bite and need to wash it down with something. The outside was crispy and not burnt, the inside was very juicy and tender. I would say it's one of the best chicken sandwiches I ever had or maybe I just haven't had fast food for a really long time."

This place is right off Washington Square, not by Union Square.It's in a public area of the residence hall at this address.

If you hit the Kosher area, you've gone too far!While it's true that this is a ""heat lamp"" location, I doubt my sandwich was out for more than five minutes since I went during lunch time. The easily accessible items were fried and grilled chicken sandwiches, some kind of chicken nugget-style items in boxes, and waffle fries. There was also a sign to ask if you were looking for something else. My fries were made on demand.The special sauces were passed out under the watchful control of the staff. It appeared the limit was two. I took one barbecue sauce an I thought it was plenty. Mints, mayonnaise, and mustard were on the customer side of the counter, so I took a bunch.Since this is a college food court, all counters share the same beverage selection, as well as big ketchup and mustard pumps past the registers.This was the first time I had Chick-Fil-A and I found the fried chicken sandwich quite tasty. It had rather thin breading, and lots of chicken, which was to my liking. I also like the fact that it's just chicken and a couple pickle pieces, allowing you full control of the rest.

The same goes with the fries.And the saddest part!..... the condiments of Ranch, BBQ, Honey Mustard sauces are distributed by the cashier ladies and there is a limit of 1 per person. !!! ACK. How can this be? My favorite part of this chain IS the condiments and yet to be limited w/ their small rectangular sized portions of only 1ounce is ridiculous!Yet, seeing as how I'm so homesick for California eateries/my fave fast food chain, I purchased my Chick-Fil-A meal.I consumed the waffle fries first and used the sauces sparingly and instead resorted to eating Ketchup provided by the NYU cafeteria so I wouldn't be done so fast with my BBQ sauce. I opened the chicken sandwich which was wrapped in a folded foil bag and it looked dry. It was okay. It could have been GREAT if I had some delicious Ranch sauce to go with it....My lemonade was too sweet.A fly hovered around me.

The staff is not friendly.. we ordered from yelp, delivery guy super cool. Chick fiil a lacking. I ordered extra Extra pickles. Nope. I ordered "" a shit ton of Chick-fil-A sauce. Nope. To add insult to injury they send  3 sauces for 8 sandwiches and 5 fries. Huh? Think we will pass on this franchise. Even the one at NYC was better. And that Was complete trash.  If your having yyour first go, I'd say head in to Manhattan. At least you can get some real chick fil a feel."

Horrible service, horrible staff! It's super unorganized to be next to a  sports stadium. The cashiers and the people taking your order do not communicate correctly ( how if they take orders on the iPad), they overcharge you. They're so busy trying to get people off the line, they don't check to make sure they have the right order down. The chick fil a in manhattan are so much better. The service that you'd expect from chick fil a  is what you come for, outside of the food being okay. If i wanted shitty service (excuse my language lol) i would have went to McDonald's! This is the second time i had an issue at this location, and 3rd time for all chick fil a I've visited. First and second time was my fault. I will be sure NEVER to visit this location again.

I ordered the Spicy Chicken sandwich and 8-piece nuggets... they messed up my order. Instead of nuggets, I received waffle fries... I went back to the counter and informed the cashier, who quickly corrected it. When I got back to work and opened my Spicy Chicken sandwich, there were no pickles. I was super disappointed b/c I love pickles... but the nuggets made up for it. They were the BEST chicken nuggets I've ever gotten from a fast food restaurant!

I have been contemplating on whether the wait on a long line was really worth it. I went with a friend who was very inpatient and didn't think it was worth it to stand on a long line to wait for a sandwich. After a long 15 minute wait I finally got to the counter to order a spicy chicken sandwich and a small strawberry milkshake .My plan was to take it home but I was to anxious to taste and see what it was like much to my disappointment I didn't like the sandwich,  the bun was very greasy and the chicken salty although crunch but I couldn't finish it. The only good thing was the milkshake it was thick and very creamy I enjoyed everything about,  but the sandwich was a big flop for me. I might come back another time to see if things have changed ."

Mobile order pickup is a shitshow, especially with the Doordash guys crowding the pickup counter trying to get people's attention. There's a kiosk at the front that you can use to tell them you're there, but it's only if you use the app. So me and a few other non-delivery people were waiting a long ass time for our orders.All the while, the people behind the register are just yelling out customer names at the top of their lungs. And for some reason, a manager(?) decided rush hour was the best time to train/admonish some of the staff.The place is also full of high school kids.That said, the food is also trash. Not at all the great chicken sandwich I remember. And the waffle fries were soggy and not crisp at all. And they didn't honor my request for extra sauce that I wrote in on the pickup notes. Of course, if you go up to the counter and ask, they'll give you all the sauces in the world free of charge, but they had taped up my bag and I was just trying to get the hell out of there.Basically, go get the ChickenShack next door instead.And also dock CFA a star for their political views."

The problem with this Chick Fil A is the lack of security. I'm sorry to put it like this, but this location becomes ghetto when the kids come around after school. Last time I was there I had to walk out because they were fighting and throwing chairs near the exit, and of course I was in the middle of it. Chick Fil A staff failed to call the police or do anything about the situation. It becomes a huge issue when customer's safety are put at risk. Having a hired police officer on site at all times would solve the problem here almost entirely. My best advice is to avoid from 2-6 that is when this restaurant tends to get crazy.

Political opinions aside, the food is just too good to resist. It was actually my first job working at a Chick-fil-a and I'll always feel some sort of way towards it. I mean have you tried their waffle fries?!I was so excited to hear one was coming to Brooklyn and close to where I live! Ugh so hard to resist. Whenever I go home to the south it's always a place I go because I know the service and food are so good. This place does a pretty good job of keeping up. I will say I've gone a couple times now and the line is always out the door, which isn't a bad thing but be prepared to wait. They're pretty good at taking your order in line and moving the orders through so by the time you get to the front your food is pretty much ready. I will say it'd be nicer if there was more seating, instead of standing spots. I guess this is the NY lay out for Chik-Fil-As since the ones in the city are the same. So be prepared to take to-go because seats are never open. The staff for the most part have always been super fast and friendly but it's what you can expect from primarily high school aged employees.I love getting a #7 grilled chicken sandwich w/ bacon, lettuce, cheese and tomato that comes with fries and a coke. Can't go wrong there or go for the classic chicken sandwich. Even the salads are good. If you've been curious, it's something you definitely should try!"

They have a separate door and line for pick up orders and walk in guests. The place is very clean, and a kit of standing room but seats are limited.For breakfast I had their biscuit sandwich which was amazing. The biscuit was warm soft and flakey. The hashbrown is also a perfect crispy. For lunch i had a spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries. The sandwich couldve been far spicier. It doesn't even compare to the MCD spice level.Also inquire about their many sauces. I was a huge fan of the Polynesian sauce and their original chick-fil-A sauce"

The service is too notch as this location. The lines are long but it moves quickly I would say no more than 10 minutes from the door to the register. They have employees there to take your order while you're on line and then you give your name at the register and pay and receive your meal. I've dined in as well and it was fine fast food restaurant dining as far as the service goes. I don't know how long they will keep this up. Since this is extremely exceptional servicefor Chick-fil-A. I'm a long time customer and never got treated like this. I'm a long time customer and typically they might come around if they have enough staff and take care off your needs especially if you have kids with you, but it's not standard. This time they asked me how the food was, if I needed any more sauces, napkins, refills, the works!I'm going to end this with some highlights for the busy NYer:-Exceptional service-Long but fast moving lines-Consistent great tasting food-No inside playcape for kids-No drive thru or parking-Great location right across from Barclay's!"

But my Cobb salad came without a dressing and it was when the bizarrest (and quite unpleasant) conversation of my week took place. So, I got to my table, set it up for my kid and me, and opened my salad box. There was no dressing in the paper or plastic bag our meal came in. No biggie. I walked up to the counter and asked a different employee for a salad dressing. Here comes insult 1. The first thing that she said was, ""I can only give you a dressing if you have our salad. Did you even buy a salad with us?"" I told her I did and pointed at my table. She walked back with me and checked my table for the presence of absence of a dressing. Which was Insult 2. Yes, I walk into restaurants and ask for single-serving packets of salad dressings in random. Or I stuff the aforementioned packets in my shoes and ask for a second helping just for the heck of it. No, I don't, and there is Trader Joe's across the street. They probably have better salad dressings, anyway.On the way back to the counter, I asked her if they had a blue cheese dressing. She said no, they didn't have it, looked at me like I was unreasonably demanding, and said they only had one kind of a salad dressing (hard to me believe), an avocado lime ranch. Then she added that it was a recommended dressing. In the whole fast food chain, they only carry one kind of dressing? Then she said something along the line she would only give it to me since my salad  came without a dressing (Insult 1, part 2). Which she had already established by inspecting my table, as if she couldn't take my word for it. What kind of customer service  is it? I don't know what to make of it. Was it a lack of training or poor social skills in general?"

It did not have the creaminess that i am used to.

NOPE! They got BOTH items in my order wrong. I asked for no ice in my drink and they packed it full of CRUSHED ice (i.e. basically watered down and impossible to remove when it got to me). I could've dealt with the ice had they not messed up my sandwich. I'm simple: chicken sandwich no pickles. I just want to chicken and buns. Instead, they sent me a sandwich with pickles, cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce. All of which had soaked into the sandwhich and the cheese was melted onto the chicken making it impossible to remove. I've never had this poor of service from a Chick-fil-A EVER!!! Ruined my night."

I only wished there was an area to sit down and properly enjoy my food. I ended up eating most of the waffle fries in the bag on my way home.

Well clearly the person who took her my food had to have walked right by me to give it to her.  I'm confused.  It seems like this restaurant has gone in the wrong direction during this pandemic."

221,/biz/chick-fil-a-new-york-19?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,New York,3 star rating,1/9/2020,"Despite the fact Chic-fil-A has traditionally worn its antiquated and concerning ""religious"" beliefs on its sleeve, they do manage to make a good chicken sandwich for a reasonable price.  After the bumpy road the company traversed trying to make its way into the city, it seems that they're here to stay (and have certainly lasted longer than its similarly antiquated brethren, Carl's Jr., which shut down in just 5 months despite its location at Penn Station; a hotbed for the market who would prefer its ""technically not prison food"" food).  This is the first location I've visited after escaping the south. I cam around 9am and the store wasn't unbearably busy.  You enter and walk through the zig zagged line as if you're approaching a Six Flags ride and place your order for one of their various chicken products fried in their signature batter (which includes pickle juice, giving it that signature ""southern fired"" flavor).  Place your order as your called, stand in the waiting area, and respond to your name once your order is ready. There are three floors, including an upstairs seating area and I believe a roof top, through I've seen neither myself.As for the food, I'm a traditionalist; less in the ""we should donate to organizations that forcibly attempt to re-educate homosexual people"" and more in the ""maybe just order the chicken sandwich without all the extra stuff on it"" sense, so I always gravitate to the traditional chicken sandwich of the chicken biscuit for breakfast.  These are the products that made chic-fil-a the company they are today so why alter what works? Not to mention they're one of the few places you can get a true southern biscuit for breakfast.  Feel free to add lettuce and cheese and everything else, but its all superfluous.  For a reasonably priced ($10 for a meal with about a dozen little hashbrown bites and a small coffee) and reasonably reliable breakfast, I'll likely return, unless their ownership decides to take some unnecessary but predictably deplorable political step.  No need to eat chicken with a bunch of weird religious biases when you can just go to Popeyes."

Milkshakes in general are something you should get here. Salads are an option as well if you do not want the traditional chicken sandwich or spicy chicken sandwich. The place is huge, there is even a rooftop area which I have yet to see. Overall, the place just needs to improve customer service and reduce customer wait time. Good to have the place around or course it is just now open on Sundays to satisfy your chicken cravings. Grilled Chicken Nuggets are also very underrated, try this in the future."

I'M NEVER COMING BACK to this location.Update: They didn't submit the second time either ! No wonder I waited nearly an hour. They said that our name wasn't in the system which doesn't make sense since we had a receipt which clearly had our name on it. No stars."

Wait time for lunch is not bad. About 5-10 minutes. The chicken sandwich here is delicious. It's nice and warm and the chicken is crispy and they always ask if you want sauce. The bun is soft and has two pickles. Chicken is well seasoned too. Delicious!

It's the least I can do. Walked in and was surprised to see they had a few workers with the iPads for expediting orders. (I've only ever seen this at their drive through locations). Service was swift & great (as expected, I mean it is Chick-fil-A). After receiving my order, I noticed my chicken strips were cold. I brought it to their attention and not only were they super accommodating, but they even allowed me to get a deluxe sandwich instead (this cost more than the strips). Thank you to the staff for looking out!"

If there was an opportunity to give zero stars, this Chick-fil-A qualifies. I'm not even sure where to start so I'll start with my most current experience. Today I went to this Chick-fil-A, ordered in advance through the app, btw- two caramel frosted coffee's, a small ice cream cone and a small Dr Pepper. When I got to the store, I checked in immediately and WAITED 22 MINUTES after I was told my order was ready through the app. I watched at least 15 customers on line order their food, get it and leave during that time. Now there's a little bit of history behind me waiting at this particular Chick-fil-A, i'll get to that in a minute. I kindly asked to speak to a crew leader, and then watched that very crew leader stock one whole case of cups right in front of my face before even giving me an ear to hear my complaint. His excuse was that they had to retrieve coffee mixture in order to complete my order. That was a crock of bull because I watched them make at least 10 frozen coffees and give them to customers that ordered a long time after I arrived and put my mobile order in the kiosk. Flashback to two weeks ago when I ordered one caramel frosted coffee and waited 15 minutes for that one beverage. When I inquired as to why my name wasn't called yet, one clown face girl with extremely large eyelashes (that caused me to lurch back when she blinked), Sharpied-in eyebrows and an attitude that made Naomi Campbell look like Cinderella, said in her thick Adam-Apple assisted Lou Rawls voice, ""Ain't nobody call that name."" Completely ignoring that most wretched individual, I asked the crew leader who happened to walk by, ""what's the deal with my order?"" Apparently not being able to read the brightly labeled name imprinted on my shirt, asked me my name and then even went so far as to have me pull up the order on my app's history in order to verify that I actually placed the order! Seriously?! ""No, I didn't order anything, dummy, I'm just standing here in my work uniform trying to cop a free beverage!"" What a buffoon! Then after verifying ON THEIR SCREEN, my order, turns around to the counter to see the beverage sitting on the counter with my name tagged on the receipt! And this dude is a crew leader?! I made him make me a new one. He reluctantly complied after retrieving what was left of his fortitude. And there was the time the mobile ordering was down, the ice cream machine broken AND the AC not working on one of the hottest days of the summer...sigh. I just can't win at this one. All in all, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this Chick-fil-A at all. This Chick-fil-A is by far the absolute worst Chick-fil-A I have ever been to in my life and I have been to many many Chick-fil-A's. The place is dirty (truth), the majority of the crew have rotten attitudes, the crew leaders are completely clueless, and their service time is absolutely atrocious. It seems as though the crew conveniently takes time conversing with one another about what they're going to do after work while making mobile order customers wait extensively for their orders. SMH. The red flag should've slapped me when I walked in to a Chick-fil-A and observed a hired security guard on watch (that's also pretty clueless himself)."

I placed my mobile order (which contained breakfast items) at 10:20 AM. I arrived at the restaurant at 10:50 AM. An employee with an iPad told me, after taking my name, that my order would be made promptly. At 11:10 AM, no food yet. I talked to another employee who was delivering orders to people in the pickup area - which they shouted at customers to remain in - who took me to the front counter. We found out that my order wasn't showing up in their system. We re-input the same order and I go back and wait. At 11:30, I ask the same delivery employee for a status update. The man next to me said he had been waiting long as well, and the employee responded, ""now, don't go blaming me for your problem. I just got to work, it's not my fault."" -- not quite the CFA hospitality they're known for! The employee sighed, took my receipt to the front again, and a supervisor and another employee came out and said that they couldn't serve breakfast after 10:30 AM (couldn't they have figured this out when I first showed up?) and offered me anything on the lunch menu for free. A fine offer, but after I placed that order, they messed up THAT, too (gave me a fruit cup and no fries)! I asked for them to correct it, and the employee that helped me seemed apologetic but exasperated. I heard other customers around me mumble that their orders were incorrect, too. Don't come here unless you don't care about waiting, your order being correct, or have the patience to wait it out for 45 minutes for your order to be correct."

Until I met this place. It was very busy, as usual - most of them are. Waited in line to place our order and watched people order, pay and go. When it was my time in line - I stood beside a family member as they placed their order and payed and a lady that works there came up behind me and line and asked me if they had called me to come up next to order. I said, ""no, she hasn't called anyone that's been in like the entire time I've been standing up here, they've just been flowing through"" well then she asks me to step back in line - I said, ""Ma'am that's my niece that just ordered and she's already paid."" She then looks at the cashier and said, ""did you say next to him?"" - she said no. Well at that point I was mad an embarrassed in a crowded line of people, so I said - I'm not moving - she can take my order. I ordered the #1 with no pickle. I got my food and made my way upstairs to meet the rest of my family. I open my sandwich and saw that it was full of pickles, I wasn't happy but I traded that bread side and pickles with someone at the table that liked pickles! But then I notice there is an ant on my bun. Yeah I'm furious at this point. I walk over to the condiment station where 2 managers were standing and told them, they turned their back to me and started whispering. Then the female said she'd go downstairs to get me another one - I said, ""I'll go with you"". So we got on the elevator and she proceeds to tell me that there was nothing on my bread and it was part of the bun. I said ""so your buns have wings? - ma'am I know that was a bug, don't tell me what I didn't see"" she says, ""there's no need to be upset baby love (yeah she called me that)"" so I in turn said, ""there's no need for you to tell me what I didn't see, just give me a refund when we get downstairs and you won't have to worry about me"". She didn't - she gave me another sandwich and I went back upstairs. In a few minutes she comes up to me and hands me a car for a free sandwich - no words, no apology,  nothing! Wow!

As i waited in line for what seemed like forever, when i finally got to the register, she asked my name, which i told her, and she went to grab my order. After waiting at the register for what seemed like an eternity, my food was placed down, and the cashier ran off again to grab my drink. While my food sat by the wet ice that one of the employees just finished spilling all over the place while trying to refill ice bins. Neither that employee nor my cashier attempted to move my bag of food away from the ice that was now causing a puddle under and around my paper take away bag. The cashier finally came back after 5 mins to inform me that they were out of sweet tea for my half and half. Annoyed already, i asked for just lemonade, which took another 5 mins. The entire time employees are speaking amongst themselves laughing and paying little to no attention to the customer. (The joys of living in nyc) this location used to be better. The service needs to improve. Especially during a busy time like lunch rush. Also, it would be nice for everyone to get on the same page because i really wanted that half and half.

In fact, I rarely choose to eat at other fast food restaurants but will still come to Chick-fil-A once or twice a month.My favorite meal to eat at any Chick-fil-A is the spicy chicken deluxe sandwich with a medium waffle fries. From the start, the sandwich is much better than other fast food sandwiches due to the amazing bun- soft and buttery. Besides that, the chicken is usually much larger than the amount provided at other fast food restaurants and so crispy and delicious. The pepper jack cheese and other toppings are a nice touch to give it that extra bit of texture and taste. I also always order the spicy version, but it's honestly not that spicy, just gives it some nice additional flavor. The waffle fries are best shaped for dipping sauces (my personal favorite is Chick-fil-A sauce) and great for fry lovers. They're not overly fried which can be a good or bad based on your personal preference.Don't come here to eat healthy, I'm sure those options are fine, but I always come knowing that I'm going to get the fried options and felt that it was worth it every time.The service here is very good, but sometimes I feel like they are understaffed. At least twice I have had to wait about 10 minutes for my food, which is pretty long for fast food. It really depends on what time you come, if there's enough employees for the rush hour but the line has died down, you'll get your food instantly, but come during non-peak hours or the middle of rush hour and it might take awhile. Also, the food is pretty hot when I receive it, but usually it would be more satisfying if it were hotter. I feel like this is a consequence of having to serve so many customers since it's located in downtown Manhattan.Lastly, I'll add that you should join Chick-fil-A's loyalty program if you like it. You get rewards decently often, and I have received multiple free sandwiches and fries through redemptions and ""Just Because"" gifts that owners will give out sometimes!"

There are two good things that happened on our excursion:1. Thankfully, the line was short. However, they were training workers independently instead of interacting with customers so it became a moot point. 2. There is ample seating. However, we did come here a little after 11a so not during peak times. This is not my first time at this particular location. However, yes, that word is getting a bit repetitive, that was when it recently opened so they were on their game. The service was fast and the food was good. This is not the case today. My friend got the new grilled chicken sandwich meal with lettuce, tomato, and American cheese. He also got a small cookies and cream milkshake. I got the spicy chicken deluxe meal, it was plain with pepperjack cheese. Both our meals came with waffle fries and medium drinks. I ordered the root beer and got it. My friend ordered a Sprite and got... lemonade. Okay then. Both our sandwiches were cold. Calling it lukewarm would be pushing it. We both should have known something was amiss when we got our order like two minutes after we were done ordering it. I can't say for sure but I don't think he was a fan of his meal. He called the Honey Roasted Barbecue sauce that comes separately from the sandwich: interesting. I didn't really enjoy my meal except for the Garlic and Herb Ranch sauce I asked for on the side.The Waffle Fries were dry. I used both the ranch sauce and mayo in them. I also needed to add salt. My spicy chicken was all right but it wasn't mind-blowing or satisfying. Before I began my meal, I told my friend I was still going to be hungry and guess what? I am. At the time of writing this review, my friend hadn't tasted the milkshake yet so maybe the whole meal might not be a complete waste of money. For the prices Chic-fil-a is touting, it isn't worth it. Save your money."

Who sells nuggets or fries without ketchup? So ask the manager and was totally insulted. The way I was talked to was offensive as last time I checked I am paying. Chick fil a sorry it's not Christian to treat customers like they are idiots for asking where is the ketchup. You gotta do better and be better. Get rid of the tall manager at counter that's an ass hole . Not good for business to insult customers.

If you can't buy super expensive healthy foods but not super cheap fast food, this is the perfect middle. Chick fil a is known for their chicken burgers (which never fail to impress and don't even mention the best fries ever created) but they have alternative healthy sides like salads to feel better about yourself. They also make their own ""Chick Fil a"" sauce that is one of a kind. It is very affordable too! The only thing is that if you're going to the one in FiDi, you better download the app and order through that ahead of time because the lines get so long they make people wait in front of the store just to order! At night the lines get shorter but it's still a wait usually. If you're getting the standard chicken burger meal, you usually won't wait more than five minutes. The absolute best part is that the entire staff is friendly and they never seem to be too busy to be nice. Whenever there's an issue they handle it with grace. 10/10"

I waited until 10:30am (13 minutes for an iced coffee?) And finally asked about it. It had been sitting behind the counter the entire time. They never called my name to let me know it was ready. Then I got the coffee and it was over a third empty (see photo). Overall I'm extremely disappointed with the lack of urgency or apologies for the delay for an iced coffee (where you have to get your own straw/creamer).

Their offerings are hands down better than any McDonald's or Burger King I've gone to in my entire lifetime, and I can tell just from the way they present their food--from the ingredients right down to the design of their packaging. Service was efficient as well, though I have to admit that it could get busier during peak hours which might mean bearing a little more patience. You can, however, skip the lines and order from your phone through their user-friendly app (which is exactly what I did before I walked through their doors). Chick-fil-A is certainly worth a try if you're ever craving some fast food, so consider ordering from them if you have any money to spend. Their chicken sandwiches, waffle fries, and desserts are simply irresistible, and now all I can say is that I wish to go back and order from them again :)"

I dropped by recently during the free nuggets promotion, picking up some waffle fries on the side.This location is truly huge. The first floor is dedicated to ordering. I went at a little bit of an off time, so the line wasn't ridiculously long, but still decent. It moved pretty quickly though, and the workers took some orders from the line to help speed things up. Since I ordered from the line, everything was ready by the time I got up to the cashier, making things really efficient. Floors 2 and 3 have plenty of seating, and then there's the roof deck, which has some additional seating and a nice view.  All the staff I interacted with on my visit were friendly.As for the food, it was pretty much the same as what you'd find at every Chick-fil-A. I was happy to have a chance to try the free nuggets, but they were a lot smaller than I thought they would be, more of a snack than lunch. I was glad I tried them, but will likely stick to my usual chicken sandwiches and waffle fries (and sometimes salads) in the future.  I'd come back to this location though, as it's very conveniently located and the overall experience was good."

This paints a picture, because I never would have considered going to a Chick-fil-A. Not just cuz of the Christian fundamentalism, but because it's fast food, just not my speed ya know?But I was gonna cry or faint or punch somebody, so I needed fuel for the next leg of my never ending journey and this was the quickest option right by the subway.Despite this apparently being a crazy busy place all the time (and it was when I went in), the staff were super, super friendly and upbeat. They never even broke a sweat. Apparently, this is something their employees are known for, and I don't know how I feel about it. It's great that people are being nice to me, I guess, but I'm skeptical. What are you doing to them to make them like that? Anyway, we're here to talk about the chicken and it's damn good. Really really good. I got the spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries, and have been back a few times to this and other locations in different states since. The chicken is crispy and juicy, not what I would call spicy but delicious. The lettuce and tomato taste good. The waffle fries are frozen and usually under cooked, so they're worth skipping (saddest thing on the menu really) but whatever, chicken!So I ate my sandwich like a rabid beast while waiting for my train, I think I growled at someone who was eyeing my public private moment too hard.

First of all the link started outside. Once I finally made it inside it was quite confusing their were employees coming around taking orders from the customers whole other customers had to wait to get to the cashier to order. Once you finally put in your order there was barely any space to wait for your name to be called out. People were rude and didn't really if they pushed you or not. The employees were trying their best but there was an overwhelming number of customers.Buying lunch from this place took about a total of 45 mins. Disclaimer: I didn't know this was the largest location they have and that it attracted so many people before deciding to go get lunch from here.

The line was out the door and round the corner. No it was not the opening day, so I was really confused. The manager had to come out to ask patrons to move all the way over because you block ppl on the sidewalk. The take out order libe is to the left and pick up orders online to the right. It was a bigger mess inside because you had to check in at a kiosk to get your food. Someone on the take out lone has a hand kiosk so your order is placed fairly quickly. Better yet your food is not sitting there waiting for your arrival. The quality of the chicken sandwich with fries including the sauce was wonderful. That's why I've given them 3  s instead of 2  s. Maybe coming on a weekend after lunch would definitely be best."

I love their Spicy Deluxe sandwich that comes with pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato & pickles. I slather it in buffalo sauce. Their tenders and nuggets are also really good. Their chicken is actual chicken & not pumped with fillers. Their fries are delicious especially when they're super hot with ketchup. I am also a fan of their milkshakes & frozen coffee. This particular location is usually super packed but it's 5 floors so there is always somewhere to sit. It's actually one of the coolest fast food restaurants for that particular reason.

It was so crowded that the restaurant had to get out a queueing strap to form a line outside, and have an employee stand at the door to limit how many customers enter the restaurant at a time. It's so busy that if you make any modifications to your order, you should probably expect them to get it wrong. I ordered extra pickles on my sandwich, and instead received no pickles. Not a big deal, and I just chose to eat the sandwich as I received it.This chick fil a is 3 stories tall and there's a soda fountain on the second floor, so you never have to go back up to the counter to refill soda.

They have rooftop seating but from when I went there last week I think you need to place reservations to be a VIP to eat on the rooftop....yes...reservations...for Chick-Fil-A. A tad bit over the top but I guess I can somewhat understand that for business meetings and all for those that work in the area. Had my usual of the Deluxe Chicken sandwich and medium waffle fries along with a chocolate shake and of course Chick-Fil-A didn't disappoint. Nice outside view from inside the restaurant of Fulton Street, while enjoying your meal and can even charge your phone or electronic devices as well.

The cashier was so nice! I gotta give it up to the staff for being so patient and kind. I've never seen customer service like this at a fast food restaurant. I sat on the roof top which is located above the third floor. It's small, very modern looking, and has red tables + chairs as well as a bench and some flower pots. I had my meal and got to look straight into the extremely tall buildings that hover over the Financial District. Plus it was lunch time, so the air was filled with chatter from ppl who work nearby. No smoking is allowed though thank god.I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with fries, a lemonade, and the very hyped Polynesian sauce. It was okay lol.

The girls with the ""its seen better days"" lamented menu items in had and mini order pads require better training and customer service skills. I download the mobile app - ordered and paid for my meal that way.  As I wait, wait, and wait some more I notice that I'm not hearing my name called. A customer walking out with food passed me, so I stopped him to ask where he received his food. I head in that direction and still no name. I walk up to the register and I explain I had a mobile order and didn't hear my name. The chap at the register was charming - wore a smile and made an effort to find my order. He asked if I was certain it went through. I responded yes. The order was not on the screen above.  A manger entered and help. Found the order, and said it was misplaced, apologized, and Bob's your uncle.  However, hand off girl with the red hair takes the chicken stripes places in bag, with 2 napkins and hands to me. Um, can I ask where is the sauce I requested via the app?  Please at least do your job and read. This is not the Chick-fil-a I know.

We weren't in a rush so it was fine, but it was noticeable especially since there were so many others waiting for their food as well.Beyond that, this location is awesome. Four floors -- floor 1 is where you order, floors 2 and 3 are full of seating, bathrooms, soda stations, etc., and floor 4 is the rooftop. I can't say enough about how excited I am for this rooftop!! Opened just in time for warmer weather. There is a decent amount of seating and a long bench along one of the walls so they really take advantage of the space. The food was amazing as always, the sweet tea was sweet - just how I like it, and the customer service is top notch. Will absolutely be back."

You people are crazy about your Chick-fil-A."" You people meaning those of us that were lucky enough to grow up eating more Chick-fil-A chicken. 4 Stars because with all the hype I expected an incredibly large and fancy pants building. Didn't quite live up to the hype and my imagination. It's tall, it's nice, but it falls in line with other Chick-fil-A's I've seen as far as quality of building, mints and food. 5 Stars because of the location. I HATE trekking to midtown, so I really only got to go when I was already in the area for whatever God-forsaken reason. Now I can actually go when I want because it is far closer to my neighborhood AND located in a lesser circle of hell. Together that makes 4.5 Stars that rounds to 5."

You can tell that the staff was in training because let's be real, NO ONE is as friendly in real life as the staff at Chick-fil-A lol.Let's talk about the size - now, if you know Chick-fil-A, you know that they are pretty small. So, it's an easy feat to be the largest Chick-fil-A in the world. The size of the building wasn't impressive but it is in a nice location. The food did not disappoint! Same good ol Chick-fil-A! If you are new to this amazing fast food joint, try the Cookies and Cream milkshake. Just do it. It will change your life! I have dreams about this milkshake.. (fatty at heart). I usually get the 8ct nuggets but I also like the Grilled Chicken Club sandwich with the waffle fries of course and ALWAYS Chick-fil-A Sauce. I am obsessed with this sauce. I always like to get a little extra for my house... Yes, I'm addicted lol We'll be back when we need our Chick-fil-A fix. I just wish it was closer to my house so that I can stop in for breakfast for a Chicken Biscuit. It's honestly one of the best chicken biscuits out there!"

It usually takes me a bit of time to get around to review s, but dude who just provided exceptional service to me on the first seating floor a few minutes ago; you deserve 5 stars. Now the food; chicken is juicy, biscuit is fluffy and very buttery, with the right amount of crumbly. I like my biscuits a little taller with a bit of crunch on the outside, but these were still great for the price. The hash browns are neatly stacked in a tiny box, bite sized crunchy and not dripping oil. I got a large coffee instead of oj (probably should have gotten the oj). Coffee is fine as well.Overall, great meal for$7.52 (including tax)"

Typically when a chicken sandwich is made the bread is supposed to be toasted and buttered, and my bread was neither of these things. It actually was a little hard. The fries tasted like typical fries but they only filled the cup halfway (so maybe order up if you are starved). Mobile ordering doesn't really help get your food quicker either. This is because your order doesn't get processed until you arrive and have entered in your code into the kiosk. Every other Chick Fil A I have been took allows you to choose ""I'm here"" so that when you walk in they have your food prepared. Overall nice Chick Fil A but I wouldn't make it a priority to visit next time I'm in town."

I usually get the spicy chicken deluxe sandwich meal which comes with your choice of drink and a side. The sandwich is so amazing. The chicken is perfectly breaded and has just the right amount of spicy kick to it. Even if you get the sandwich for takeout, the breading stays pretty crispy, which is a plus. The only reason I took a star off is because their fries are pretty inconsistent. Sometimes they're perfectly fried and crispy, but sometimes they do get a little soggy even if I eat the fries right away. :(By overall, the people who work there are super sweet and accommodating which I think is great especially for tourists coming to visit this location. FYI!!!! During lunch time, it may be faster to just wait in line instead of ordering on the app! (BEHAVIORAL FINANCE, PEOPLE!!) But if you're coming after the lunch rush hour, I'd definitely recommend ordering through their app, especially because you could stack up points and getting free food for it"

While the city was initially apprehensive about welcoming in someone from south of the Mason-Dixon line, after getting our teeth into their chicken, the city has welcomed it in with open arms. Capitalizing on the trend of building up, not out, the store boasts the largest footprint ever built, and features 3 floors of seating, including a rooftop porch, with views of 1 World Trade Center. Having shown up on the first weekend, I had expected a few fumbles or growing pains, but the line moved quickly, my order came out hot and fresh and everyone gave me the Chic-fil-A southern charm. Given the limited floor space the store actually has on the ground floor, the line can definitely grow out the door, and waiting may be a bit of an issue. My advice would be to order ahead, so you can pop in, grab that delicious chicken and go about your day."

I did not get there early but around 1-2pm and the line was down the corner so I decided it wasn't worth the wait since there was no deals, no giveaways (at my time of visit) and all was at regular price with the staff handing out paper menus. I came back 30 minutes later and the line was shorter. Many staff members on hand on every floor to greet and keep things in check. Everyone I met on each floor were very friendly and greeted me with a smile.Ordered a ""Hand-Spun"" milkshake and a Chick-fil-A Chicken. Crisp and as good as the other Chick-fil-A I have had on 6th Ave and 37-38th Street, Manhattan. The milkshake I can say is better and can only compare to the other fast food places like McDonald's and Burger King or Shake Shack as also pretty good.The first level has no seating, it's just where you order. It is said to have five levels, possible. But the elevator only takes you to first, second and third floor then the roof. Hmmm, is there a secret to the fourth or did I overlook it. Each of the second and third floor has a seating area to the left and to the right and soda fountains+a condiment stand. I didn't look for the restroom because I did not need. Not sure if they have. The roof is a small area with waterproof like tables and chairs with a view down across the street and a view of the top of the Freedom Tower. It's a great casual dine area when warm but when in extreme temperatures/cold/rain, etc... sort of like today when it's a little chili; I did not want to sit there and eat long, so I took mt food to a lower level.So what made this visit besides the food was the grandness of opening day in sharing EatMoreChicken with other Chick-fil-As and the view from the roof."

First, their layout for the drive through is TERRIBLE and the line is always around the corner and blocking the street. Once you get in line it seems like it does move and there are always workers taking order in line so that's not an issue.However, more than once I've come here and received my food, delivered out by worker, while I was still stuck in line behind 6+ cars with no way to leave without waiting for them to get passed the window. Most would think - okay great, food was delivered quickly! But that really doesn't matter when the food delivered is COLD and I still have to wait in line behind some slow af cars because I'm blocked into the drive through. Only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is because both times they forgot my sauce which I specifically ordered and the slow wait time in the drive thru gave me a chance to ask for the sauce at the window.  I've struggled for a while whether to even support Chick-fil-A because of their anti LGBT views and would justify it because well their service is so good! Not at this one! Since this is the closest to me and their service is absolute GARBAGE I guess it's finally the excuse I need to cut them out for good."

23,/biz/chick-fil-a-los-angeles-14?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Los Angeles,1 star rating,9/4/2021,I went to this Chick-fil-A two days ago in the morning the team member taking my order was rushing me and looked so impatient. When I got to the window the manager didn't even seem to care what I had to say and when I received my order it was absolutely horrendous the spicy sandwich was so tiny and tasted nothing like what I get at other cfas. The hash browns were undercooked they were white. Sadly I was so hungry that I had to force eat them! I hope managers who do care take care of this review!

When I asked for my drinks I was immediately given an eye roll and attitude...which doesn't make sense considering it's my order. Then she threw 2 ranch cups at my bags and I had to ask her politely not to throw them at me. I didn't realize employees left their morals at home. This shouldn't be accepted treatment for your customers, as someone who works in customer service I know we all have our days but that was utterly disgusting behavior. Not to mention the food wasn't great either for the way I was made to feel. Disappointed to say the least, lost a loyal customer."

I will drive 20 mins across town before ever entering this location again. Out of every 10 orders they'll get one or 2 correct. This is actually the most dismal accuracy I've ever witnessed. Called to ask for a refund the last time I ever went there. They didn't give me my drink, Mac and cheese or fries and I ended up with 3 chicken strips instead of 8 nuggets. I was yelled at by the manager and told that if I wanted anything they would remake it and I would have to come back to the store, when I was already back at work. Obviously very angry about something happening but it didn't have anything to do with me. She yelled at me and told me she wouldn't do anything and then escalated to nearly threatening me to not to come. I will never return as that manager will surely tamper with food to get back at a customer. This location is an absolute mockery of the Chick-Fil-A name and mission.

I'm sick and tired of their lazy work . They get my order wrong constantly . I give them the benefit of the doubt because you think the next time they will get it right but no . I just think to myself they used to be on point a while back . There has been a few times that the people taking my order have an attitude. Excuse me am I pissing you off because you hate your job ??What pisses me off is that I tell them that I've had many bad experiences and all they say is I'm sorry . Really ?? Starbucks gave me 2 gift cards because they made my drink wrong and I was like wow they know how to keep customers . Chick fil can give 2 flying f**** if you had multiple bad experiences. I can't believe I'm this mad about a restaurant thats supposed to be the freshest and nicest people . Horrible ! Horrible ! Horrible ! I hate this place now. If they offered anything to compensate for all those horrible experiences I wouldn't be writing this review . Do your job correctly and don't piss off people chick fil a .

I pulled up to the window, and the lady gave us the food without salad dressing again. I reside less than 2 minutes drive from Chick-fil-a. When I got home and opened the order, the fries were cold and tasted like wood. The sandwich was cold, and the chicken dried up. I honestly don't know why my son loves this place so much. On rare occasions, I buy food from fast food places. This time was exceptional, and my last visit to Chick-fil-a. Hiring teenagers to do an adult job is a mistake. It kills business and literally leaves a bad taste in the mouth."

Fine. This should have resulted in greater accuracy. Not this location!   I think they get my order right maybe half the time.  Not exaggerating. I've gotten Coke instead of diet coke; a chicken sandwich when I ordered an egg biscuit; a sausage patty for no reason at all -- it's all over the place.  And when I take it back to the window for correction, they have a lousy attitude about it. And unlike most menu apps, there's no follow-up, so you're never asked to rate your experience or give feedback.  Maybe this is why the AWFUL customer service persists at this location.

It should be ALL via speakers done btw... It's not safe to have employees standing so close to my car, I legit felt in fear the entire time. On top of that, if they take your order when you drive in, how does that give you the opportunity to view the menu? And I don't want to ASK them or SPEAK because that is how viruses are transmitted. It's important to LIMIT the amount you speak with customers etc because its not safe. Didn't ask me if i wanted sauce with nuggets and i didn't want to ask for it at the window as i saw an employee standing there with the mask pulled on.

It was a Saturday, too, so I knew it'd be open. This place was just the right remedy since I only had a light lunch. It was somewhat packed in the drive-through lanes, but they moved fairly quickly.I ordered a Spicy Chicken Sandwich and a Chick-fil-A Deluxe Sandwich. I tend to eat the spicy selections with a side of ranch so I got a couple of those as well as several packets of the Chick-fil-A sauce, which is hands down the best sauce of them all.I thought I'd save a sandwich for another day but I ended up eating my lunch and dinner in one sitting. Starting off with the Spicy Chicken and drenching every piece with ranch provided that soothing kick before every chomp.When I moved on to the Deluxe, I was feeling adventurous and alternated portions with each of the sauces and every combination was a different experience. I didn't eat the rest of the night and I didn't feel like I needed to run laps around my neighborhood right after either. What an experience."

They told me it would be good for ANY food item I wanted not to worry, up to $9.00 for each of the cards. BIG LIE!!!! Even though several of us are glueten intolerant there was no exception made. I was expected to have my receipt, from weeks earlier or know the exact date and amount of the total bill and how I paid.. Life has been extremely stressful as we both work from home have travel for business and homeschool and childcare provide for my daughters children, in addition we are going through renovataions so the dumb receipt in this wacky Covid world wasn't exactly a high priority. I felt like I was being called a liar and that I had to go through alll my credit card statements to see if I paid cash or card. I have NEVER EVER been treated like this! How would I have gotten the cards and why wouldn't they simply give me value for value of what they overcharged me?

As so many others stated, there is always something missing from the order. So many times when we ordered the Southwestern Salad, they would fail to include the tortilla strips and Chili Lime Pepitas. Other times, they would place almonds instead! The Southwestern Salad does not come with almonds; the market salad does! Following the last two experiences nearly two months ago, we decided to never order from this location again. We now order from the location at Western and Santa Monica via online delivery services and we never have issues with our orders! We have ordered from the other location at least twenty times within the last two months and not once did we experience issues as we have at this location.

Sometimes the service is good, most of the time its whatever, but sometimes terrible. Tonight we waited in the drive through a total of forty minutes, but got our food in 20 min. Yeah, let that soak in for a second. Im not sure who thought this way would be more efficient, but its weird getting your food but still being forced to wait in line. When we finally got one car behind the window, we thought we were almost out, but we waited for a few mins and when we finally saw some interaction with the staff, it got followed by the staff member walking out and giving the customer a hug in the drive through. After this we continued to wait, and it kind of seemed like the person was ordering more food, once i heard the staff say would you like large or small i honked my horn to remind them there are some more people here. Mind you ive had my food at 20 min now. The staff member instantly turns to me and says ""what are you honking for?"" I replied with what had been going on, when someone pulled her back in through the window from saying more. Almost instantly after that, they handed the car 1 drink and i was finally able to move up to the window, so i asked for the manager and explained to him what happened. He seemed to understand my frustration and said hed speak to her  about it. When i tried to drive away from the window, the car that was previously infront stayed blocking me in thinking it was cute. Finally staff had to get involed to get the car to leave so they could continue to operate your business. Inshort, chickfila you need to check your staff.

For starters, the food is consistently good here and the staff is super friendly. They have never messed up an order and the food is always packaged neatly. Obviously as others have stated, the parking/drive thru situation can be somewhat of a mess depending on what time you're there. Your best bet is to come from Sunset Blvd and make a right onto McCadden. The wait varies, anywhere from 15-30 minutes, but the staff there have a solid system in place to handle the cars, just be patient. My go-to is the classic chicken sandwich and some Chic Fil A sauce. Their fries are okay, nothing special in my opinion. Overall, this is a solid location with good fast food."

Unfortunately this location can NEVER get my order right. I understand that it gets extremely busy but this has happened to me numerous times it's very frustrating. Today a friend and I went for lunch. We ordered a 30 piece grilled nuggets and a grilled chicken sandwich. I check my order every time now before driving away (I learned my lesson) and I got a very small bowl of nuggets and a chicken sandwich. I said I don't think this is all 30 nuggets. I believe it was the manager that came to the window (he was wearing a blue shirt) and said yes that's a 30 piece. I pulled the bowl out and said I don't think so. He said ""YES THATS THE SIZE OF THE 30 CONTAINER""!! At that point I felt bad for holding up the line but I opened the lid and began counting them 1 by 1. Lucky I had just sanitized my hands. As I got to number 11 I could see only 3 were remaining but then an employee ran up from the back and said here's the rest of your nuggets sorry we spilt the order accidentally. The manager kept saying sorry I could tell he felt stupid. I told him it's all good but it's crazy how this happens every time it's always wrong. The part that really upset me was how he kept choosing to argue with me telling me that's all of them! That's all 30! But he was completely wrong it was only half of them like I said in the beginning. Hopefully they can get a new management team that can lead this location in the right direction."

I immediately complained about the drink size, and when the guy replaced it, he did so with the wrong drink. So I had to ask for yet another correction. On the third attempt, he put barely any ice in the cup, so what I left with was a Luke warm tea. I didn't notice the macaroni was under-filled until I got back to my work to eat. Ordering or getting anything resolved at this location is immensely frustrating, because the location is closed off and there is only one window open to pick up orders or talk to staff. With COVID, getting close to the window means getting close to a bunch of strangers crowded up near it, which is no bueno. The pickup area is also completely outdoors, and there is little to no communication from staff, as all the orders were announced via loudspeaker. Considering the number of pickup orders and the apparent predilection for mistakes, there should at least be two windows - one for delivering orders and a second for fixing them. Also, for the first 10 minutes I was there, they didn't call out a single order for pickup - so it's not like I was waiting for my order to be fulfilled over a sea of others; it just took forever for some unknown operations disaster. I have dined at dozens of CFA locations across the country and this has been by far the worst experience I've ever had. It's so bad, it disappoints me. I would rather drive 30 minutes to the nearest Raising Canes than to come back to this location. And that's a real bummer because I normal proselytize the CFA brand. It's my favorite fast food restaurant. This location needs some serious TLC. Jesus."

Our order taker jumped lines to make sure my car was accommodated so I didn't have to wait! Chick-fil-A is great for their chicken sandwiches which I've loved for years. Grilled has less calories, which I go for. I also love the house sauce! There are a couple salad options but would skip since it's extra money to have chicken added to the market salad (even though it's advertised in the picture as with chicken while It's actually not unless requested).Nuggets are quite small, kid-size so if you have an appetite, get a lot!

Today i went through the drive thru & they gave me someone else's order. Everyone makes mistakes, its natural, so i decided to not make a big fuss about it. I went through the drive thru again and informed them that they gave me the wrong order. I then had to repeat my order again, wait in the long line, and finally get my food. Or so i thought. I get to the window expecting to give them the wrong order back, get my food and go. Well thats when everything went straight to hell. Not only did they not care that they made a mistake, they started saying we owed $7 and wanted to refund the original charge and charge us again. I asked to speak to the manager, elias, which instead of being a mediator and upholding the golden rule of ""the customer is always right"", started arguing with me. He then charged me $1.13 (i dont know how he came up with that), and gave me my food. I take off only to realize they gave me the wrong order AGAIN. At this point i was furious and decide to get out of my car and handle this in person. I mean, what does someone have to do in order to get their damn food and some courtesy? The lack of professionalism and the fact that elias literally argued with me about a dollar is ridiculous. Im a frequent patron of chick fil a, but i will take my business to another franchise. If i was a business owner i would be embarrassed to have a ""manager"" argue and go toe to toe with a customer over a dollar. I'm also be concerned that in the day and age of COVID19, they take items back from people. Its not sanitary."

They were not wearing masks. When he asked them to move to the pickup window so he can order, they refused and were mocking him for wearing a mask. They also coughed on him and a few others. They said Covid is a hoax. Then they picked up their phones and started recording everyone telling them they are going to blame those people on their social media (frame them) for bothering them . None of the workers at the restaurant could care less. There was no security around, even though there is supposed to security present there. This altercation went on for 10 to 15 mins. After month-long calls to Chick-Fil-A customer service we have gotten nowhere. The franchise owner has proven to be a real jerk. And has totally ignored the complaints.

On two occasions I've gone during normal business hours and the drive thru was chained closed. I watch many cars do the same as me and stop with confusion and then drive away. I emailed corporate both times about the loss of business and they sent a generic reply and said they'd send it to the franchise owner. I never received a reply. Then literally a day after I was raving to coworkers about the breakfast at chic fil a, they ALL went only to find the breakfast menu cut down to hot generic coffee and 2 breakfast options. To make it worse the breakfast menu was covered with printer paper!!! It looked soooooo tacky and a month later, it's still there. The employees encouraged us to reach out to corporate because they were getting a lot of heat for the sudden change and the owner was not stepping in to take ownership of the change (well besides the printer paper signs. ) Corporate once again sent a generic email about not having the kitchen space anymore. This is interesting because they had the space before and they didn't add anything to the menu.  They said they'd send my comments to the franchise owner but I know how that will go. I don't know what the future direction is for this location but it's really sad to not get the service you expect from chic fil a."

And the chicken is her favorite. She's a picky eater so getting her to eat is always good! The chicken is always well done and I never had an issue with my order.

I ordered my usual - spicy chicken sandwich (no pickle) meal with medium waffle fries and a sweet tea. I drove to chick fil a around prime lunch time (12:30pm) and the drive-thru line was sooo long, like out the drive way and trickling onto the streets long. I wish there was an easier way to pick up, because even though I ordered early on, I still had to wait in that long drive-thru lane. Just waiting in that lane ate up my lunch hour so I might've as well ordered in the drive thru lane, because I had to wait for my food to come out and I had to wait to get out of the drive thru lane as well. The workers were all nice, of course. The food was delicious, of course. The wait/drive-thru line was a little annoying. I don't mind waiting if I didn't order beforehand, but I did order beforehand... and having to wait the same time as people who didn't order beforehand isn't my favorite thing to do."

I understand people might've been taking too many sauces, but this seems like a huge over-correction. For a bunch of nuggets, it's reasonable you may want two or three sauces to dunk in, and if you're buying 5 entrees (~$25 of chicken), it feels petty to be charging me extra for sauce. Maybe we could find a reasonable middle ground between giving unlimited sauce away and being extremely stingy with it?If you're going to make a rule to combat sauce abuse, make it 2 per entree. BTW, this is just the latest in an ever-changing sauce rule. No lie, they tell me a different sauce spiel every time I'm there. This one finally broke me. It's a small thing but it bugs."

It was great I really did enjoy that and loved how close I lived near there. Throughout the years they stopped doing that. The tables to eat outside are filthy and dusty there is pigeons everywhere back then there was an employee making sure pigeons wouldn't be on the tables or anywhere around the dining area. The food is always fresh when I received it when I want to eat outside I try to ask someone to clean the table because how dirty and dusty it is sometimes they do it but recently when I ask they don't do it at all.

In general I think the best thing I had on this visit was fries. Do not recommend this location.

We went through the drive thru on a rainy day. The line was long but went quickly. The guy who took our order greeted us with a smile on his face and was so nice especially for having to stand outside in the rain to take orders. This was my first time at a Chick fil a (I know) so I had a few questions about the food which he answered no hesitation and with some humor.  The food was also pretty good. To be honest a little overrated and pricey but good. I can't wait to come back to try all the sauces. I got the grilled chicken sandwich and the nuggets. Apparently you can order as little as one nugget and as many as 30.

As an avid CFA goer I can safely say that this location has by far the most unfreshly baked cookies. They are always burned and never warm. They are room temp served non soft baked cookies. Sure, you can ask for them to RE heat them, and they will gladly oblige. But at that point you're basically dealing in second round draft cookies. The employees are great!The chicken sandwiches are great!The waffles fries are usually pretty good.But again - the cookies at this location are always really horrible.

My husband once saw an employee hit a parked car at 1am and take off. They leave beer bottles and cans all over the neighborhood. The employees will even show up on Sundays and hangout in the parking lot blasting music out of their cars and smoking and going in and out of the business. Management did nothing about my concerns even after i gave them the makes/models of the cars as well as uniform descriptions of the employees involved.  I have  talked to 2 of their directors and all I was told was that they would talk to their employees but yet the behavior hasn't stopped and its been months. When dining at this establishment you can even hear the loud offensive music coming from the inside as well as employees having inappropriate side conversations. My daughter was dining here and witnessed police showing up and looking for an employee. Its safe to say that this particular chickfila doesnt hold itself to the same standards of others, they are all individually owned so it makes sense."

As a Texan visiting for the summer, I was excited to find this location only a couple of blocks from the Airbnb I was staying at, only to have that excitement quickly turn to disappointment when I sat down and opened my bag.My portion of waffle fries was small, and worse, they were stale and greasy, as if they'd been sitting under a heat lamp for too long. Worse yet were the chicken strips. Rather the the big, juicy chicken strips I'm used to, I was presented with small and sad little chunks of chicken. My friend's meal was just as bad. Her fruit salad was partially frozen and once again, a skimpy portion. I know everything is bigger in Texas, but this was ridiculous. In addition, the tables were dirty and sticky and trash littered the ground. However, seeing as this location is in the depths of Hollywood, that was no surprise. I'm giving this location 2-stars because I realize that it's extremely busy and offering the best quality is a challenge, but it was still a huge let down from the Chick-fil-A I know and love.

Hearty, hot sandwiches, perfectly breaded strips, thick waffle fries, and lemonade that hits the spot are all trademarks of CFA that hold true in the Hollywood location. The major detractor for this location, however, is the service: normally, an apathetic, underpaid associate is to be expected at a drive-thru window; even more understandably so when they're forced to sit in the unrelenting sun for their entire shift. But what truly ruins the experience in my mind is one simple fact:They never even remotely get my order correct.Sure, everything on the receipt is exactly as I ordered, but somehow what I'm handed through the drive-thru window bears so little resemblance to what the receipt reads that I wonder if there's not some wormhole between the ordering line and the window to teleport me into a different dimension. I've lost so much money via orders delivered into my hands missing multiple items that I just can't make a case to go back any more. It's almost comical how without fail, every single visit, items are missing and others are totally incorrect. No matter how delicious the food is, it doesn't matter if I don't receive it.

I went to get some food at the restaurant today ( on my lunch break ) and as usual there was the right before work crowd. No problem. I ordered my food with Dylan and that was the beginning of my ordeal. Dylan was polite quick and knew the menu but when I ordered a large fry and a separate meal he or someone assumed I didn't want/need the additional fry order which I would later come to find out was missing.I get to the window pay for my food and drive off and as soon as I got the end of the street I realized the fries weren't there. Should I have reviewed my order yeah maybe, but regardless I know what I ordered and that is what should have been put in the bag. Anyone who has been to this location knows it's a traffic nightmare so getting back to the drive thru is no easy task.I spend about another 7 minutes or so trying to get back around all whilst eating my delicious fries and sipping on the lemonade, when I finally reach the order taker I tell him they forgot something and he laughs off the error... whatevs! I get to the window ahhh the lovely window now void of fries other than the ones in my belly and with a half empty lemonade that would of made Beyonce proud and had Rhi Rhi bouncing around. The supreme leader of the shift is at the window with a look of surprise as to why I am back, I let her know without any attitude that my fries were left out and I had to come back, with a smile and no apology she takes my money and returns to me my fries. Great! Ohh by the way do you mind refilling my drink please... as I watch the smile disappear off of her face as if I was asking solely for the purpose of a refill she proceeds to go over company policy about not refilling cups in the drive thru ( did she ever think that messing up orders was probably not allowed either ). I ask her well at least out of courtesy could she, since I wouldn't of had to come back if my order was correct when I came the 1st time. She  pauses and with all the CS training she has ever had puts on a smile and ask could I at least take the lid off which at that point I thanked her for the service and declined the refill and well here we are. It wouldn't of taken any effort to refill the cup regardless of policy and her position. I am the one whose time was consumed doing a remedial task that was not my fault in the first place.

So long story short, did not receive the meal we wanted and Chic-FilA was unwilling to rectify it.  Unhappy Consumers."

I'm not sure if anyone else experienced that. But it is funny to see so many people freaking out about it & the sauces when it's just so casual back home. I guess that's how born & raised in LA residents must feel about In-N-Out? I would skip the drive thru line & just walk up & order. Whole process took 5 minutes while the drive thru was super super slow. Good if I'm feeling homesick but not worth a big adventure in my opinion if you had it back home. Just not the same.

It was my friends birthday and he had never tried chick-fil-a so I'm glad he chose here to eat. This was my first time at this location and I thought it was a cool experience compared to others. Just a huge walk up window where you order and you eat outside. They also have a drive thru but the line was so long. It's a difficult area to get in and out of when it comes to parking but duh the food was worth it. The cashier was nice and helpful. Our food was really quick yet still so fresh.

Some people like having double sauce cuz they like sauce. When i said it's ok I'll pay for extra the girl stopped me and was like well they're no charge but you can ONLY get 4 sauces...excuse me?????? Like you guys are already closed on Sundays and now you're taking away my extra sauce privileges? Rude. Now, when i ordered...half way thru the drive thru a worker ran out and gave me my food. Speedy. But weird. I then realized I should grab a milkshake for my boyfriend. So, when i got to the window the girl said a name and i said no, sorry i already got my food but was wondering if i could buy a shake? She then rolled her eyes and rudely asked well what type? I just said chocolate and she responded with ya. ok. Girl, i don't need your attitude. You work at chick fil a...you're paid to be nice and say my pleasure not ya. Ok."

Anyways, drivethru was packed. CustomerService was great... I got the recommended, which was actually vegetarian not vegan. It was a garden pack wrapped with cheese, blacks and corn. And this wrap combo was superb with honey mustard dressing. I'll eat the other wrap half later with ranch dressing. I'm sure it'll be amazing too. Plant-based doesn't have to be just vegetables. The original combo #8, aka cool chicken wrap is a great choice for those diet conscious or gourmet peeps. It might be a couple dollars cheaper than vegetarian too.

For lunch (depending on my mood), I'll order the chicken strips or the original chicken sandwich sans pickle + waffle fries (THE BESTTTTT) + lemonade or a sweet tea. All their sauces are amazing!! Not sure what's in the chick-fil-a sauce but it is delicious.  This particular location doesn't have indoor seating which kind of stinks, but the staff is super friendly and the drive-thru system is pretty efficient so 5 stars. This is the only Chick-fil-A that I know of in LA, so I'll always be coming back."

Look, I love Chick-Fil-A, everyone loves Chick-Fil-A but this location is not a Chick-Fil-A.Sure it looks like one, has the same name, has the same menu, but be warned it's a hot mess.- Traffic - You mean to tell me they can have FOUR employees to take your order but they can't delegate one person to directing traffic? Words can't express how bad the Drive-Thru structure is with this location. It's a loop that exits out to the line that piles up on the tiny street. And because people are hungry and greedy they won't let people out of the Drive-Thru. We were sitting in the Drive-Thru after already getting out food for 15 minutes the other night because it exits to where the line starts on the street.You NEED an employee at the end of the Drive-Thru to direct traffic and stop cars from bunching up so people can exit.- Service -You know ho everyone claims that Chick-Fil-A is the nicest place in the world? And their staff is exceptional? Sure maybe fire the Valencia branch. But this one? They are h o r r i b l e. Now I know how crappy it is to work in the food service industry and I can't imagine doing it in the heart of Hollywood. However the whole staff really needs an attitude check, at the very least those who take your order at the Drive-Thru. They mumble, they are typically very rude and they're always talking to each other ignoring customers and swearing. Then they walk up to your car and act like you're inconveniencing them. Not what you except from Chick-Fil-A.- Location -Sure food is food and you can't exactly change your environment but every time I go there it's overrun by homeless people. The seats are never clean and they don't seem to wash the exterior of the building.-Finally... the Food -It's really hard to mess up Chick-fil-A because every location has the same ingredients and the same menu. However it's pretty obvious that the people who work here don't care about the quality of the food that they sell.The fries are almost always cold and extremely hard. On two occasions I've gotten food poisoning from their chicken sandwiches which were not served hot. This past week I found a few long hairs on one of the sandwiches. And the sodas are always flat or not mixed properly.I understand how difficult it can be to work in fast food especially at a very busy location as I have done it many times in the past, but when you combine all of these problems did you Chick-fil-A is it no better than your average McDonald's.If you are really craving some Chick-fil-A go to a different location."

I don't eat fast food very often but I can tell you, it doesn't seem very fast anymore... this location had it on point! Maybe this is how they always do things, I don't know.

And the food is incredible! I don't know what exactly is in Chik-fil-A sauce (I'm pretty sure it's just a type of honey mustard), but it is DELICIOUS! The ""Original Chicken Sandwich"" is SO good, I don't understand why they even have other items on the menu. Not only is their food very, very good, but this place runs with an efficiency you will not find at another fast food joint other than a select few In-N-Out burgers. Seeing a line of cars wrapped around the block would usually be a death sentence at another restaurant drive-thru, but not at Chik-fil-A! They are great at keeping the drive-thru line moving so regardless of how long the line is you shouldn't ever really be waiting for more than ten minutes. They also have a patio seating area, and counter ordering, which is just as fast if you decide you'd rather not eat in your car. They also have their own parking lot, which is small, but still nice that it's there. So, this place does have its drawbacks. What are they? I'm glad you asked. As I mentioned the parking lot is small, and difficult to get to. If there IS a line wrapped around the block (don't worry, the line will move quickly) you may not be able to get into the lot. There's no ""indoor seating"", there is a patio seating area. And while it is Southern California, it would still be nice to have some sort of actual boundary between you and your food, and Sunset Blvd. Also, on the occasional days where there IS bad weather you don't want to sit outside. But none of the drawbacks cost this place a star. Because it is Chik-fil-A! Get the Original Chicken Sandwich, with Chik-fil-A sauce!"

This location in Hollywood is the worst we've been to:1. 1/5 location. Due to location, it's all outdoor and there's a strong smell of marijuana (patrons, not really their fault)2. 1/5 service. They couldn't get our order right. We always get meals with cups of water, aka just the entree and fries. We've never had a problem here but the person kept putting bottled waters on and trying to charge us. We explained it to her probably 4 times that we just wanted a cup and not to charge for the water and she kept telling us our total was still the same. I eventually said maybe this location won't give free waters because it's Hollywood, so I had her scan my app that gives one bottled water free, and she did but it didn't change our total and she charged us the full price for both bottled waters. By this time there's a huge line of impatient people behind us so we had to go pick up our food.3. 2/5 food.

The customers and staff take up any parking nearby and customers throw their trash out onto the street. Every day the streets are filled with chick Fil A trash. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. There are multiple dumpsters and trash cans nearby but no one bothers to use them. These people and the people of Chick Fil A are why Hollywood is so dirty and run down.

You enter the parking lot through McCadden and Sunset. There are two drive-thru windows to order from, which makes the process faster. The line goes pretty fast so you're in and out pretty quickly. The people at the window have always been courteous to me each time. We always get the chicken sandwich, waffle fries, and sweet tea. GET THE CHICK FIL A SAUCE. It goes with your sandwich and fries. Their sweet tea is better than McDonald's sweet tea. Their waffle fries are always perfect. I wish there were more locations in Los Angeles!"

The food is consistently good and the service is generally pretty good as well. Tonight I went to there and they forgot to put a sandwich in the bag. I should have checked it, but did not until I got home. I just assumed that they had put everything in that I had paid for. Annoyed that I had gotten all the way home without some of the food that I paid for, I went back to get the missing item.Upon returning I asked if there was anything that the manager could do for the inconvenience. He then came over and said ""I can't just be giving away free food."" I thought that this was pretty disrespectful considering that I had just spent about $40 there and had left my food at home getting cold so that I could go back for the missing item. Overall I was just really disappointed with the service here and will probably think twice when deciding where to go next time I'm in the mood for a fast food fix."

Lines that stretched into the street blocking traffic at every open hour, awkward merges with people approaching from the other direction, irritated drivers weaving through drive-thru traffic trying to get down the street.Things are not perfect, this location may handle more traffic than any Chick-fil-A in the country, but management keeps this location adequately staffed to move cars through the ordering and payment process better than any restaurant I've seen.Bravo. The food is... Chick-fil-A. Give it a try... it's the same everywhere."

HORRIBLE customer service and I mean HORRIBLE, the girl was in the worse mood anyone can be, she wouldn't let us decide on what we wanted and when I asked my husband something she kept getting involved and kept saying ""what?"" When I wasn't talking to her first of all, and when I was talking to her she also replied with her ""what?"". She gave us so much attitude and didn't even want to tell us what drinks she had, excuse me for never trying this place before. Would I eat this again? Maybe, fries were soggy, food was good. We might eat it again but I definetly wouldn't go back there. I would rather stop by any other place in the area."

I ordered the Spicy Chicken Sandwich combo. The chicken was juicy and a good size, but it could have been Spicer, I think. The waffle fries were the standard waffle fries, but it was a good amount. Kudos for not skimping on the fries. Also, people had told me to try the got the Chick-fil-A sauce, and it was indeed tasty. Free refills on drinks. Yay.My order came out a little over $8.

I also ordered the grilled market salad minus the blueberries and blue cheese for my mom. Usually she's hooked on the salads Wendy's has to offer.

I had a #1 upgraded to large and got the lemonade. The chicken sandwich was perhaps the juiciest I have had from a fast food place and the fact that it was a very simple burger but still so flavorful won me over!! I had came to this place once before but I have to admit it really didn't impress me... this time around it was a different story! Will definitely be back when I'm around the area.

Been living in LA all my life and not once had I been to a Chick-fil-A until today. It was a windy afternoon in Los Angeles and I thought of scooping the homie Alfred up from Glendale after my shift had ended, and thought that today would be the day to try Chick-fil-A. The drive (including the traffic) wasn't much of a problem as we were bumping ignorant rap music throughout our journey. When we had reached our destination, we both ordered, and literally no more than 15 seconds after we had ordered, our food was ready. When I reached into that bag, the first thing my tender fingers came into contact with were those remarkable waffle-cut fries. Not salty at all, with a crisp layer until you hit the smooth potato-ey center. Now for the climax. That first bite of the spicy chicken sandwich had me shaking my head in disbelief: I had entered a realm where a fast-food powerhouse had blessed me with real chicken. As I came to my senses, I realized that it was all real. God bless this establishment and the fine young staff operating it."

This Hollywood location is no exception, and I have to admit I love hearing the employee say ""my pleasure"" after handing me my order. BTW, the new phone app is awesome! You can order your food ahead of time and pick it up as soon as you get there! My advice on this particular location is to avoid the drive thru. They are pretty fast, but if you order on the app and then park you'll be in and out much faster, and you can pressure them to give you more sauce. COME THRU with that ChickFilA sauce!"

They have parking and decent outdoor seating. Customer service is good.Food is above average for a fast food, better made, we like their chicken sandwiches (have to have that pickle inside), the meat is tender and tasty.

I hate that it is located in the middle of Hollywood off two of the busiest streets in Los Angeles. However, I find myself almost always going every time I drive by it.The drive-thru line can get a little crazy at times. There's two lanes, which is good, but they are almost always super backed up. Sometimes it's so backed up that it runs onto Sunset Blvd and causes traffic. The employees stand outside to take your order, and you can pay with their portable devices as well. If you want to dine-in, this location has its own parking lot, but it can get hard to get into because the overflow of drive-thru cars. When I dined in for the first time a few days ago, I realized that this location does not have indoor seating. You order at a cafeteria-like window, and then they call your name when your order is ready. They have a decently sized outdoor patio with a bunch of metal tables and some bar seating. I hate that the line is always long, the location sucks, and there's no indoor seating, but I have to say that this location has had some of the best Chick-fil-A I've ever had. For some reason, I'm not sure what it is, but their food tastes better than other locations I've been to. Maybe I'm crazy or maybe it's because after waiting for so long at the drive-thru it makes it THAT much more delicious and worth it. It's just amazing."

Oh, and try their yogurt parfait, it's so yummy, the yogurt is restaurant-quality and loaded with granola and fruits. I've ordered through them, too for catered lunch meeting at work and it is always a hit. They would even whip up a vegetarian wrap if you ask them. The delivery persons are always nice and courteous, and they don't ask for tips! Their receipts don't have a ""tip"" section. Check out their menu selection for delivery/catering, your co-workers will thank you. And the total charges are always on the lowest end of our budget.

It seems like they have an endless choice of sauces that you are welcome to get several types of without any hassles. And the # 1 reason to try it: the chicken is actually chicken!

I also ordered the grilled market salad minus the blueberries and blue cheese for my mom. Usually she's hooked on the salads Wendy's has to offer. But today after 2 bites of this said she said, ""This is better than Wendy's!"" I wish I had before pictures, but it was too delicious."

I have been here at least 6 times and received great customer service. The food is always as advertised and pretty fresh, and they simply give you what you want in regards to sauce and other condiments without charging a arm and a leg. The one star deduction comes not from bad customer service, but rather I pulled up to order drive thru (which I usually never do) and the two young men joked and conversed for a good 45 seconds, I had to ask ""so how do I order"" and they apologized and took my order. But once I got to the window my order was wrong and although they were not going to charge me I insisted and made them charge me the difference, it was unusual that they had made a mistake so I am sure it was because the order taker was not listening."

The pickle and the tomato are nice accessories but the chicken definitely stole the spotlight!The food is amazing but I had to take a star off for its location. There is no indoor seating and just not enough outdoor seating for the waves of crowd.Expand the location please! Chicken is still amazing!

However during the lunch hour rush they have multiple people in the drive thru lines taking orders from your car before the menu board to speed things up. They did a great job at that. Lines of cars were spilling out to the side street but the cars steadily moved thru with orders ready and paid for by the time you pulled up. Nice!Food is what you would expect. Get that Polynesian Sauce!! Yum.  Chicken tenders are nice but I wish they were a little crispier. I tried the strawberry shake too and it was really good. Tasted like it was real ice cream.

The first time I actually came across this franchise was down in South Carolina. At that time I had arrived too late and they were closed. And i did not have an opportunity to go back. So I was very excited to have the opportunity to try the food out. From what it looked like there was no seating area in the inside. There is slather area outside with tables set up.  Customers make the orders through a few windows and then walk around to pick up the food when your name is called. I had visited the place twice in a week due to the location. Both times the staff was very friendly and customer oriented. The cashier that night was very cheery and personable. Not surprising that she was from San Francisco.  One somewhat comical moment sticks out in my mind. A bunch of customers were waiting near the pick up window and I definitely heard my name called. Now when I got to the window my food was not yet ready and I am very reasonably patient. At the window was probably a female supervisor who was just cleaning around the area and her body literally up against the window. Needless to say some or most of us were probably staring too long but I was there because my name was called. She addressed my by my first name and told me that my order was not ready yet. I was in Los Angeles around Christmas time. It can be crowded but everyone knows where the line is and I did not see any unruly people or line cutters which surprised me. This location is right near a busy and always packed In-N-Out burger. The food is very good and this place did not disappoint.   The humorous incident that I described above was most likely and isolated incident so should not be exists with every visit. But the good service and food seem to be a constant."

I work less than half a mile away so me and my co-workers order from here about once a week.  The restaurant is always very clean and the staff is very friendly. My only gripe with this location (and it's a big one) is that they tend to botch large orders. I notice this mostly through drive through but it has occurred to me when I walk in as well. I'm to the point now where I will take everything out and count it where as before I felt bad doing so because I'd be holding up the line. This has happened to me about 4 times on an order of 5-8 meals. Missing fries, wrong sandwiches...a little of everything. My usual spot was the Cerritos location (but it's too far just to pick up lunch) and they always have excellent service. After going there for years and years I've never once had this happen so I know it is possible. Over all this is a good place to visit but just make sure you check your order before you leave."

Chick-fil-A is definitely a good contender for satisfying any craving for a fried chicken sandwich.My only complaint is the waffle fries.

The line for the drive thru is constantly backing up traffic and it is near impossible to find a parking spot in their small lot. Even given all of this, I go when I'm craving their chicken sandwich. Last night I went to grab dinner. Again, scene at the drive thru, to be expected. They have 2 drive thru lines, which you think would help but doesn't. It just creates more confusion at the window. This time, I saw them give my food to the car in front of me. They literally handed her my bag of food and drink. When they went to give her my shake, she clearly realized it wasn't her order. She handed the food back out of her car and into the window. This REALLY grossed me out. Then they had to fix her payment since they charged her for mine. This whole ordeal took about 10 minutes. When I went up to the window they gave me the same bag of food they gave her originally, YUCK and when she handed me my shake, the lid was off! From all of the back and forth, the shake was a runny mess, no longer fresh and creamy and the lid being off caused it to spill all over my car. I was SO pissed and instead of offering napkins, the rude girl at the window gave me a ""Get moving"" look. Normally the service at Chick-Fil-A is great, NOT at the Hollywood location! Also the fries are always mushy and need more salt. I will not be returning, will have to hunt one down that's close to work or on my way home or something."

Whenever I find myself in a city that has one, I go out of my way to grab some. Sometimes wayyyy out of my way. This trip was certainly no exception. This location is situated on Sunset Blvd.and in the midst of the very touristy area of Hollywood. They do have a walk up window and an outdoor seating area with tables, chairs , and umbrellas for shade. I'm sure the people watching at this location must be fantastic!We were in a rush and had to use the drive thru, however. They do have 2 lanes to help expedite things, which I certainly can appreciate. Even though we arrived during the lunch rush hour on Monday, they were still friendly and efficient. We ordered 8 sandwiches with some yummy waffle fries and drinks. I was shocked at how fast(and accurate) or order was prepared for us!....and of course it goes without saying that they are still scrumptious as ever!! I have 2 more left in the fridge as I write this review and I am already wishing I had ordered more!Yay! I'm a fan!4 stars."

I've heard about how CFA supports the community and believes in giving back. Aside from that, I've heard the food is simple phenomenal. I finally found time to visit the Hollywood CFA and was delighted by the service and blown away by the food. I ordered nuggets and enjoyed the frosty Lemonade. The first bite of those nuggets was love at first bite. I knew I had finally found my go-to place for the best chicken! A few days later I decided to go back because I got my intense craving for those nuggets and was sorely disappointed. There was a woman who looked like she was in charge who kept glaring at me as if I wasn't allowed on the property. I felt harassed and violated by how hatefully she stared at me. I have never met this woman in my life yet she had a problem with me. I proceeded to ask for her name but there was no need once I saw her name. NATALIE. I don't know what I had done to upset this woman but I can definitely say because of this experience I will NEVER return to this restaurant. Not only did she visually harass me, she was on her phone which is very unsanitary when you're dealing with food. I work in the food industry so I understand what IS and what ISNT acceptable. To my complete HORROR she dropped fries and proceeded to put them in a bag and serve them to a customer. I am disgusted and appalled by everything I saw. On top of that I saw her smart mouthing her own employees...what kind of leader does something like this? I am heartbroken because the deep respect I felt for the company has been torn apart by a simply horrible experience. Hopefully I can find another CFA that will uphold the standards I've heard so much about and maybe there I can be treated like a paying customer."

Compared to the east coast locations I've been to the food is on par. This location is difficult to get into. The line for the drive through is always ridiculously long and slow moving. There's no separate entrance to the parking lot, so you have to wait in the drive through line to get into the parking lot which is kind of annoying. That said, it's in the middle of Hollywood, and the fact that they offer free parking at all is wonderful.I'm disappointed that there's no eat-in area, but there is outdoor seating with umbrellas for most nice days. If you haven't had their food before, in general it's on par with Wendy's quality except the chicken is much more natural looking and thick."

498,/biz/chick-fil-a-los-angeles-14?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Los Angeles,4 star rating,4/3/2015,Came to this location for the first time. I was really worried about parking on a Friday afternoon around 1230 but I did find three spots open. I also found that it was easier to enter the parking lot where people exit the drive-through instead of trying to go where people enter the drive-through which is basically impossible. You'll be okay if you look out for cars because people are mostly waiting at the cashier window versus tons of cars streaming out where they exit. I really like this location because even though it's outdoors they have tons of water misters and surprisingly you get free beverage refills because a staff person will walk around and ask if you want more drinks. So they ask that you remove your lid and straw and she'll take your cup and refill it was whatever beverage that you had. The line here moves really quickly and the service is great. The food is good too. Today I had the eight piece classic chicken nuggets sweet tea and fries. I also got the ranch dressing but it also comes with some sort of chicken sauce as well for dipping. I didn't open the chicken dipping sauce and will just try it later at home with my own chicken. I've only eaten at Chick-fil-A a handful of times but it's nice to know that this place it is open until 3 AM. I really wish that they were open on Sundays though. There are plenty of umbrellas and tables and counter seating. I don't know if there's a bathroom here. It doesn't look like it. Do not park across the street at right aid because there is like a security guard watching to make sure that you don't park there and go elsewhere. Overall a fun location to go to because it looks so different and it's outdoors. I've been to the one in Westwood and there's a new one in Culver City pie of the store off of Jefferson which I need to go to at some point as well.

In his post he mentioned that it was so delicious, it made him overlook the company's questionable business practices.I would recommend if you haven't tried. Asking for extra pickles is a good idea. Polynesia sauce was ok, similar to bbq sauce,  but the real star was the house sauce, which compliments the sandwich well.Service was good. Free cold brew coffee during the month of February. I'm not sure what these questionable business practices are that Chang refers to, but until I go back and enjoy this sandwich a few more times, I don't want to know. Ignorance is bliss."

I then get back into the car to realize they forgot to add the cheese I asked them to add at the drive through and told the manager as he was still outside. Instead of apologizing and offering to add it for free (at this point they had wasted nearly 20 minutes of my time), he snottily tells me I have to GO BACK to the window and pay for it if I want it added."

Not only is the food here bland, the place is an absolute circus act as far as drive thru/parking. The drive thru line backs up from McCadden Pl. to Sunse t Blvd. So drive thru patrons sit in the far right lane of Sunset Blvd, while people actually trying to drive down Sunset swerve and lay on their horns. I also really condemn this location as they leave the surrounding area littered with food wrappers and take out bags. Their parking lot, all litter, continues into the street, Chick-fil-A garbage decorates the Rite Aid parking lot across the street, and I always see a sad looking Rite Aid employee having to sweep up the aftermath caused by Chick-fil-a. The milkshake machine is always ""broken"" late night. Weird."

I have tried a few different chicken sandwiches from Chick-Fil-A and I really didn't see the major difference in any of it. All the sandwiches are basically the same just with a minor swap of cheese or a different sauce or a simple add on. Really that counts as choices?? Not in my book. Waffle fries are nice, tasty and different than the ordinary fries everyone serves up.Nice part is that there are two drive thru faster service and faster drive thru."

I don't need to repeat myself 5 times and then get the wrong order like I do at other drive thrus. My gf lives down the street so I occasionally come here when we just want to grab something quick late-night. Definitely a little healthier than most fast food restaurants. Food is not the BEST I have ever had, but it is decent for the convenience and price.Overall -  Excellent consistent customer service! Exactly what every drive-thru restaurant should be like.

I was surprised how quickly LA gravitated towards this place but embrace it they did.The staff here is beyond friendly and helpful. The way the staff treats you makes me feel as if I'm dining at 5-star restaurant (no pun intended). Yes, it is a restaurant but not the type you need a reservation for.I like the fact they have two lines for drive-thru and they don't charge ridiculous fees for condiments. That's right you can have an unlimited amount of condiments and it doesn't cost a thing, like J.Lo's love.It's tradition that all locations are closed on Sunday, so don't try them on a Sunday it won't work for you, TRUST.This location also has a spacious outside patio for eating if you choose to dine there.Actually, you can't dine inside here, there is ONLY outside seating.But it's LA, so it's usually not a problem, you dig?"

That being said, try and not make it a REGULAR THING as it is STILL fast food!! There are still chemicals, additives and sugars in all of their foods, even their grilled menu items. However, this place is far better/healthier than any other fast food joint I've seen....

Sometimes I will order an extra grilled chicken breast, slide it over my fried chicken breast, and then you have one mondo sandwich. Great for a post-workout and not terribly unhealthy. Here's another tip, pass on the ice cream. Looks great, but tastes like ice-vegetable stock. However, while you're not eating ice cream, help yourself to a chocolate chip cookie. They are uniquely delicious with a little touch of an oatmeal-chocolate chip flavor. This chick fil-a is particularly well run. Everyone has always been very nice and accommodating at this location.

First thing to know about this location is that there is no indoor seating. Everything is outside, including the service windows. Luckily they have misters spraying on hot days, so it wasn't so bad to be outdoors on the day I visited.I let the gentleman taking my order know that I had never eaten at this chain before, and he was happy to suggest some of their popular items, and answer any questions I had. I ended up selecting the Spicy Chicken Sandwich meal, and it was ready in less then 5 minutes of ordering.If you haven't tried it, you should know that their classic sandwiches are served dry - meaning there is no sauce added to them. Honestly, the sandwich doesn't really need it since it tastes good on its own, but it is cool that they offer so many different sauce flavors on the side. This gives you the option to add what you want to your sandwich. I liked having the ranch with my Spicy Chicken.And I want to give a kudos to the service staff here. During my short lunch, I witnessed one employee handle cleaning tables as well as offer drink refills (since there is no soda fountain outside for customers to do this themselves). Even the manager came by to make sure I was enjoying my meal and had everything I needed. My overall verdict of Chick-Fil-A is that it seems to be a quality fast food chain on par with Jack In The Box, which to me is better than McDonalds or Burger King any day."

Score!  I've never been to this location and didn't realize that it's not a dine-in restaurant.  You order at the window, find a seat outside, grab your food when they call your name, and eat outside.  There were a lot of people eating but there were still plenty seats to go around.  We had combo meals #1 and #2.  I had the regular chicken sandwich and my friend had the deluxe one with bacon and what not. With a side of lemonade, it was just so delicious.  Really love the food but not sure if I'd go back too often considering the horrendous parking situation over there.  I probably will try it out again another day and will just have to hope that it's not that busy I guess."

They have salads and shakes and other ""goodies"". The prices are very reasonable for your choices. There's alot of healthy choices to be had. It's mainly outdoor dining and there's limited parking in their small parking lot. I recommend coming on a motorcycle or parking on the side street located on the east side of the restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised. I've been to their Rancho Cucamonga restaurant and you can dine indoors there. It was great. Too bad this place only has outdoor dining. Maybe because of the potential vagrants and squatters? Stop in if in the area."

LOLI know it's .90 difference but I asked to speak to the manager. After all how any people have been paying a higher price when the menu shows a lower price? It adds up! The manager at the registers came over and pulled a menu out of the glass container that covers the menu and revealed a menu underneath with the ""new"" prices, and said oops. He didn't really apologize or even offer to give the meal to us for the posted price and just walked away. I don't normally go to this place, but had a craving.

Right on the corner of one of the most noisy crossings.I love watching people running back and forth, cars beeping, Intensive traffic. Keeps your brain feeling awake while you there.Standard menu of what a fast-food restaurant could offer. Sandwiches, nuggets, shakes. Average price. Though the way they serve it is nice: your name is called over the loudspeaker so that you could come to the window to pickup your order (so if you are eating incognito - keep that in mind, of make up a name ;).Seats are solid metal - so don't freeze your behind in the evening. There's a lot of umbrellas over the tables, so you won't burn.Drive through are is always crowded (makes me think the place is popular) and is has several menu set on your way so that you could overlook or change your mind before you get to ordering.Frankly, not a place to go all the time, but in case of need - you may be sure, their food will not disappoint you.Visit?

Ever since the grand opening of this place I knew it would be a problem (because of the way my diet is set up). Just a little history on my love for chick fil a. Back when I was in high school (2006), they used to sell chick fil a everyday for lunch. The very first time I tried it, I knew I was never going to quit. I have been eating it ever since and don't even plan on stopping. I have tried most of the so-cal locations, and when they have a grand opening I am usually there too. The Hollywood location was only right! I work near this location so Im here almost 7 days a week. I have tried all of the breakfast items, all of the lunch items, and some of the limited item such as the chicken tortilla soup which is really good. My favorite items for breakfast is the chicken breakfast burrito and hash browns, and for lunch the spicy chicken sandwich. I try not to get the fries with it only because I feel like Im in a food coma after eating everything, but the fries are amaze-balls too. My #1 favorite is (drumroll) THE MILKSHAKES. Now don't judge me but I DO love a good milkshake, and chick fil a has crazy good milkshakes.It taste like they took my favorite ice cream, my favorite chocolate, and everything good, and came up with this milkshake. I know it should like a lot with the chicken sandwich, fries, and milkshake, AND YOUR RIGHT! It IS a lot, and I probably shouldn't eat all of this at one time, but I don't judge you...so again...don't judge me!! JK Oh and the service is amazing like ALL other chick fil a location. ""It's a great day here at chick fil a my name is_____ how can I serve you today"". That never gets old."

I am from the South so I grew up on Chick-Fil-A. I was so stoked when they opened this location in Hollywood. The food is the same as any Chick-Fil-A location obviously (although they seem to burn the fries quite a bit here), but the customer service is no good. When you go to a Chick-Fil-A, everyone knows how friendly the workers are and how they always say ""my pleasure"". Well, here, it just seems like they hired a lot of the kids who may go to Hollywood High School across the street and they are just working to have an ""after school job."" The customer service is hit or miss. I have had multiple issues with having the wrong order given to me or part of my order missing etc. So now, I only come to this location if I am hungry last minute and in the Hollywood area. Otherwise, I just wait until I take a trip to Camarillo for shopping to go to the Chick-Fil-A in that area (check out my yelp review for that location. They are amazing.). If you're in Hollywood and you're hungry definitely drop in and get a bite.

Also, the Polynesian sauce is pretty much it's biggest draw for me.. I just can't help getting the biggest pack of nuggets, crispy waffle fries, and some Polynesian sauce.But there's a lot of hype around the chicken sandwich, and honestly, did a side by side and the McDonald's Spicy McChicken tastes about the same and costs a fifth of the price.

It was OK...definitely not real impressed. Had the regular spicy chicken sandwich combo. The sandwich itself was average...it did have a fair amount of spice (which I liked since I enjoy spicer foods). The patty was breaded in the spicy batter...not super crispy but not too soggy either. The bun was spongy and there were a few dill pickle slices inside the sandwich. Waffle fries were plain but LOVED their diet lemonade w/ Splenda! Tasted like homemade lemonade w/ real lemons...hard to believe it was sugar-free. I'll definitely drive-thru for a XL Lemonade on a warm day if I'm in the area.

As in, I could talk myself into eating anywhere else. Plus I've found some spot on copycat recipes online for their chicken coating. The waffle fries are worth a mention though. Also worth a mention: The creepy customer service. Maybe I think it's creepy for political reasons but it is oddly great. Too great sometimes.

If you want the whole shabang, meaning...lettuce, tomatoes and cheese, just order whichever sandwich you choose as ""deluxe.""Other notable items are the regular chicken sandwich and the chicken strips if you want to ditch the bread.  If you want to eat healthy here, it IS possible.  It's not as tasty as the sandwich, but good enough......just get the grilled chicken strips or the grilled nuggets.  It's sure to satisfy your chicken craving without killing your diet.Lastly, Chick-Fil-A is not open on Sunday's, so catch them when you can on the weekdays and Saturday :)"

So when I discovered this  chick-fil-a pretty much just across the street from my son's school, I was intrigued. After this whole hoop-la over Chick-fil-a, how could I not try it? Plus, I was starving! The Chicken sandwich was very good. Better than any other fast food chicken sandwich I have ever had. I chose the spicy chicken deluxe (I think it was called). The chicken was fat and juicy and perfectly spicy.  It really was the star of the show. Everything else was whatever. The bread and veggies, were normal. The waffle fries were pretty bland and flavorless. My Arnold Palmer... To much Arnold, not enough Palmer. But that chicken, was really, really good. It's a great chicken sandwich.

I really loved this place from its customer service to the ambiance to its food. When I went up to order, two windows, I thought I was going to take forever waiting, but the service was pretty fast for a Saturday night around 8pm. The line wasn't that long and there was not a lot of traffic in the drive thr. When I approached the window the gentleman taking my order was very happy and friendly and started chatting it up. I expected good customer service, but not an actual conversation so I enjoyed that interaction highly. He was at tentative to my order and repeated my order to verify if he had taken it correctly.   The wait was not much I'd say it took around no less than 15 minutes. When I got my food it was neatly packed and distributed. The burger was small, I expected bigger seeing how most fast food restaurants do this, but it packed in flavor. I would say the burger tasted like a combination of a rally's burger and a Wendy's burger together. That's the best I can describe the flavor of it. I got a number 2 I believe, I do remember ordering one of their classics. The fries were oh so good! Those can be described as a McDonalds/In & Out taste, but without the grease. I got full seeing I was enjoying the taste. The seatings were outside and right infront of the street. I think out of the food and the customer service that was the best part.  I can understand if the service has gone down for some people and they have seen better times. I just think they should balance out there reviews instead of giving them one star, if they do consider that to be one star they should provice some reason as to why instead of stating something that every common review provides. Honestly be fair to the restaurant and yourselves. Just like every other restaurant they have low points and high points.  I don't care about these companies political standpoints, if I were offended to some extent of the founders words, I would first analyze what he said instead of making a statement. The man said he did not approve of gay marriage and he funds money to organizations that are against it. He did not say to murder, or raid gay couples. All he did was express his freedom of speech and the company should not be condoned for it. It seems these days no one can say other do anything that provokes violence. People need to get some patience. All in all I loved my experience there and I will be returning."

The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition is to treat every person with Honor, Dignity and Respect - Regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender. And to this date they continue this tradition in the over 1,600 Restaurants run by independent Owner/Operators.We are all imperfect and at times we make mistakes and sin, the fact that I believe in Bible based principals and you choose not to doesn't mean HATE or H8 as a certain group of individuals like to cry out!, it just means I don't believe in your lifestyle.So for all the Homosexuals that may read this review, I don't agree with your choice of lifestyle but I have NO HATE towards you as an individual.   (1 CORINTHIANS 6:9-11)(9) What!

It was so long ago that I don't really remember what I had but I know that it was good enough for to warrant me getting really excited and telling my husband that we HAD to go there before our trip was over. Turns out that didn't happen until the last day of our trip, but SO glad that we made it a point to stop. We had just had a huge brunch (see my review for Saddle Ranch Chop House), and had to be at the airport fairly soon, so we decided to get the food to go and eat it later. I was worried about how well the food would travel, so I tasted a waffle fry when it was hot and it was yummy.  Hours later it was pretty much your average cold fries, but still good. The chicken nuggets were bigger than I expected, and very meaty. I like that they offer so many dipping sauces, and, though I read that they have a strict max, they put 2 of each in our bag - shoot, if I had known that, I would have gotten 4 different types! The creme de la creme here for me though, was the sandwich. Everything, from the soft bread to the perfectly seasoned meat (which wasn't very spicy, despite it's name), was just.... superb. If it tasted that good cold, DAMNNNN it must have been amazing hot and fresh. I would recommend this place just on the strength of that sandwich. Everything else ain't so bad, either!"

A huge face staring at me and asking my name as I order. A monitor with a face looking right at me. Feeling weird mode on. The strange part was the face taking my order was not the same face taking the money nor dishing the food. huh? ..so there's someone alone in a back room with cameras taking orders and asking names. ..ok.I like that they have the calories on the menu but oh man are those a lot of calories.

Yup, their chicken may be tasty, but man does their PR completely suck. Look, In-n-out may have bible verses typed on the soft drinks and other food wrappers but you don't see people protesting them simply because as religious as they may be, they don't shove it down your throat like Chick-Fil-A seems to love to do. On that alone, I may never come to this location again. It's just too close to the heart of L.A's gay community. So if you're seen in line getting your sweet tea, well let's just say it's not going to get you a whole mess of friends. Then again, being in line here means you're going to be there for a while, even if they have two ordering windows. The process to get that simple chicken sandwich to your grubby hands is a long one. Seriously. While I may say that the criss cross fries are pretty damn tasty, what exactly makes them better than the waffle cut fries from Carl's Jr? Then again, Carl's Jr. is also one of those who doesn't support gay marriage. So hey, politics and fast food simply should not mix... again though, the amount that Chick-fil-a jams it down our throats is just unappealing and drops that craving for sweet tea. Anyhow, the service is slow and on a Friday... my god, this place is packed. Extremely packed. Frankly, the wendy's does an equally good sandwich and the only reason this gets to the middle ground is that it is the ""healthier"" option when eating fast food, but the shit you need to deal with to get it just doesn't make it all that worth it. Also, the limited dipping sauces, as if it was some treasure or rare commodity in how they look at you sideways when asking for more packets just make you feel like you peed in their bushes.

If they were open then, they'd get a 5. But I guess you gotta respect their values.I usually stick to chicken nuggets or sandwiches + fries and a shake. You can really taste the quality over other fast food. Definitely a solid upgrade over the dirty, mini Carl's Jr that used to reside. The chicken just tastes so much more tender and juicier than competitor's. Both the cookies and cream and banana pudding shakes are bomb. Taste much more ""real"" than other competitors as well. Doesn't really matter what time of day it is, but the drive thru line will always be out of the parking lot and into the street. Part of this has to do with the popularity of the location, open late, etc but it also has to do with the drive thru design. There are two lanes that merge into one, but the cashier/food window is at the front of the building, so there is a long exit driveway once you get your food. If you got your food at the end of the line, there probably wouldn't be so much logjam in the street. Anyways, don't let the spillover into the street deter you, it moves quick and you'll get your food faster than you can say closed on Sunday. P.S.

While I was ordering, I saw a bun fall on the floor and a staff member pick it back up and place it on an order without even thinking twice. I said something to the cashier and was told that I must have been mistaken. I almost walked away right then, but my friend assured me the food was great and I should forget about it. My food came and I hunkered down to devour it, trying to forget the bun dramz. Not only did I find a piece of long hair in my fries, that clearly wasn't mine, but I brought the issue up with another cashier and was told ""it could've been yours, sir"". Ummmm last time I checked I wasn't wearing a weave, wig and anything that resembled a foot long piece of ratty hair. A full refund was in order and perhaps a toy or something.Thankfully my innards have been sparred from eating at this crap den again.I gave this DUMP 1 star for service, that sucked it harder than Monica Lewinsky, and sanitary conditions that a rat would abhor."

A friend gave me several of his ""first 100"" coupons which entitles you to a feeel meal with drink. No where on the card does is say you can get lemonade. in fact three times I was able to get lemonade with no extra charge, but they it started to change. The price has been different at least four times, even the sandwich you order has been changed a few times and each time there is no real reason why. FREE is FREE and if there are restrictions then they should be printed on the dame card. PERIOD. Furthermore the staff should know what to charge each customer. In other words read from the same freaking script.Each time I've presented the card I've been with at least four other people who are actually paying full price for their meals, so it's not like we all are getting free meals. The last time I went in I was asked to pay $1.00 for the lemonade and this is when the lady who ordered before me with the very same kind of card asked me why I had to pay extra. When I told her that lemonade does not come with the meal, she tells me she never pays anything extra and she always gets the spicy sandwich and presents the very same cards I have and not once has she been asked to pay. We both spoke to the manager and he had no explanation as to why this happened. Well first he said the person made a mistake, bu the lady shows receipts she has from other visits where she's paid NOTHING extra. He just looked at us both and said ""well I'll give you the lemonade this time""Moral of the story is FREE means just that. Not FREE when we decide or FREE for certain people........AND I'm Black, so I can fry way better chicken, so screw Chick-Fil-A"

I had the most unprofessional incompetent girl at the drive thru the other day, not only did she not know about her items on the menu but she kept going off the screen to ask someone that did know what they were doing. As it's a dual drive thru FOUR cars in the other lane went before she could finish taking my order (my order was simple one chicken sandwich and 4 nuggets the end). It was like she was still distracted by what had happened moments earlier........see below.......Not only was she not paying attention BUT she and the person handing the food out at the window recognized the people in the car in front of me and they chatted and laughed and brought other people working onto the ordering screen so they could see them in the car. I mean I can see and hear your entire conservation so laughing and giggling while the car behind you is sitting and watching you guys chat and NOT order for five minutes, is a little ridiculous!!!. I was close to just driving through and away. It was sooo unprofessional. C'mon Chick-Fil-A keep up your standards of friendly family oriented customer service!!!"

BUTTTT.....The employees here.. well... they're pretty terrible.  I've been here several times since it's opened and have had bad service everytime.  They don't make eye-contact with you, or smile at you, or even greet you very enthusiastically.   Oh... And going to get refills - the worst!  Each employee will tell you something different; ""Oh you should go to the pick-up window to get a refill.""  ""Please wait in the normal line to get a refill."" ""Wait for somebody to come to your table to get a refill.""   - Pretty annoying.  I'm not trying to be snobby - but CFA is supposed to have amazing customer service. Oh.. and it doesn't even really need to be said, but the parking/traffic situation at this location is incredibly bad.  Again let me say, the food here is terrific.  And if you've never been to Chick-Fil-A, it's worth the hype.  But... go to the one by USC or even the one in Northridge.  Try and avoid this location."

Being from Georgia and eating this frequently, you can only imagine the pure look of delight on my face when I realized they were finally open. I've been eating Chic-Fil-A since I was a child. 1) The chicken is always consistently amazing...at every location. So juicy, seasoned perfectly. Always hot. Always delicious. 2) Honey Roasted BBQ sauce. It's so delicious. This is the only sandwich that doesn't need any sauce, yet their sauces are the most delicious of any sauces and therefore, I must drown everything in it. Mmm.3) The Staff is always super friendly. Every location. I love it.I rave about this to everyone I know. (I'm good for the business!)Only 2 cons:1) This location is outside seating only. There should at least be heat lamps in the evening and I'll be a happy girl. Pssh. I'll be happy any way with Chic-Fil-A in my hand.2) Minus 1 star for Chic-Fil-A explicitly disliking same-sex couples."

Its fantastic! With just 2 pickles per sandwich and just a perfectly breaded chicken sandwich is constantly perfect every time.

My lil heart could not bare it since I lived 40 minutes east in Diamond Bar. So, my selfish heart made my ex-bf drive me 40 minutes to the Torrance location at least 1ce a week. I was beyond excited when I heard that they would finally open a location near my  home in L.A. I came here 3 times the opening week. I stick with my usual 12 piece nugget meal, Polynesian and Chick-fil-a sauce, large waffle fries, and lemon meringue pie. The salads and wraps are also pretty good.The service is pretty quick even though the double drive-thru line looks like the wait from hell. The staff is pretty cool too. They will actually ask if you need anything else as you dine outside.It could be for sentimental reasons lol but yes, I am giving them 5 stars and adding them to my must eats list."

I know they've only been open for a few months, but every time I try drive-thru for takeout the line is excruciatingly long and the facility is impossible to escape once I've gotten my food. As the line wraps around and cross the exit, it's difficult to exit because you have to wait for people to allow you space to leave.-On the flip-side, when I've tried to dine in there, I usually have to enter through the exit just because the drive-thru line blocks the entrance and you'd have to wait forever to go inside.Second, the sauce situation:-I understand Hollywood is a hive for the homeless and psychotic, and leaving sauce out in the open (as opposed to behind the counter) for the starving would result in pandemonium, BUT the people that work here need to be a little more lax with giving out sauce.  As we're all aware, most of the food at CFA is simply a vehicle for the sauce (i.e. CFA sauce) and skimping on the sauce is a damn mistake. Last night, I kept having to come up and ask for more sauce, and every time I asked for a couple of CFA sauces, I would only get handed one. Even when I asked for Texas Pete Hot Sauce, and asked for two, I would be handed one and forced to ask for another. I was with a very hungry friend who wasn't aware of the etiquette of sharing 8 piece nuggets (2 ppl = 4 nugs each), and when I got back he had eaten 6! I mean come on!Get it together Chick FIl A!I'll always love you but you're bringing me down!"

It must be me, but if you're only going to serve up one form of meat for all the years you've been in business, it better be the best. Chick-Fil-A is far from it."

I haven't had a good cluck since junior high!The spicy chicken sandwich was difficult to man handle since it comes pretty naked (unless you specify to use one of their 7 sauces) but it was a down ass chick fo sho. I know it's fast food but it really did hit the spot and then some. I wasn't a huge fan of the waffle fries because they lacked a distinct flavor (read: not drenched in grease and salt), but the fountain cherry coke made up for the dullness of the 'tates.I'm glad I finally checked out the Fil-Aster but I do admit that my lack of poultry sandwiches in the past decade or so makes this one hard to rate against other joints, however it satisfied my need for a quick and convenient meal and the service was extremely friendly and fast, so there's something to be said for that!"

I really like the spicy chicken. It's actually got a real kick to it and consists of a meaty filet instead of a mouthful of fried breading (like McDonald's and other restaurants). The chicken also has a unique flavor... good seasoning? This location is obviously overpacked, and they've figured out a system to get the cars through, but the street where everyone turns onto is so narrow. Can't wait to try their shakes another time!"

Turns out though, even the opening of a Chick Fil A is a big deal in Hollywood as there were lines so long you'd think Ryan Gosling* was signing autographs.Anywho, when I finally craved a fast food chicken sandwich enough, I came here and waited in line. The staff were super speedy. We ordered and got our food all within about 15 minutes. Love the dipping sauces, they're a nice touch. Ranch and the Chick Fil A sauce were my faves, ya know, the Midwestern thing. Yup.Another nice touch was that one of the staff members came out and offered to refill our beverages. That's above and beyond your normal fast food place. You can also giggle at the person whose job it is to stand  and guard the condiments.

When does it close?!Anyway, I've heard a lot of people sing praises for Chick-Fil-A, especially David Choi. When one opened up in L.A., I made a mental bookmark which finally got fulfilled on a whim!My two friends and I went to the drive-thru, which was PACKED even at that time of night. I ordered the regular chicken sandwich--I always go with the basic when trying a new place--and my friends both got the Spicy Chicken Deluxe. Oh, and an order of waffle fries!I thought my sandwich tasted delicious. It is to chicken what Filet O'Fish is to fish. There's a nice tang to the sandwich, and the chicken was super crispy. Refried? The waffle fries...I expected something more, but I can't really expect much, can I?Overall, it's a good place to eat when it's in the area, but I would say that it leans toward the expensive side for fast food.

I waited 15 minutes in line to order my food, which would've been fine if the food and service were good. I will not return to The Hollywood location, and here is why:1) The chicken nuggets were lukewarm. 2) The waffle fries were lukewarm and on the soggy side.3) Their policy on KETCHUP is ridiculous, and I consider my experience with ""The Ketchup Gatekeeper"" to be BAD SERVICE. Here is what happened:My name was called to pick up my food. (FYI, there is no self service area to help oneself to condiments, napkins, straws, etc. You are given these items by the staff.) Upon getting my meal, I asked for ketchup for my (large) fries. I was given 2 packets. Then:Me: ""Could I please have a lot more ketchup?""Chick Fil A girl: ""Our packets of ketchup are much bigger than regular ketchup packets.""Me: ""Yes, I can see that, but I like a lot of ketchup on my fries. Can I have a few more?""Chick Fil A girl: ""Well, that is all I can give you.They may look small, but they hold 3 times the amount of ketchup than regular ketchup packets.""Me: ""So you won't give me more? Really?""Then, without saying a word, she walks away and I see her talking to a co-worker, I assume it's her manager or supervisor, then she comes back to me empty-handed and confirms:Chick Fil A girl: ""I am sorry, that is all you can have. We have to be really careful with the sauces.""So I took my food and went to my table to eat it. I mean REALLY, I am not gonna stand there BEGGING for more ketchup, when it is clearly kept under lock and key. I felt like I was in a ""Seinfeld"" episode titled ""Rejected by the Ketchup Gatekeeper."" And I am sure this poor girl who has to enforce the ketchup rations has been trained to never go over the ketchup quota, or else!Ironically, a few minutes later another customer comes up to me and hands me a packet of ketchup. Apparently, she was standing behind me while I picked up my food; she heard the conversation, thought it was RIDICULOUS, and asked for ketchup FOR ME, since she doesn't use it on her fries! SO, CHICK FIL A, if you ever read this, I enjoyed 3 packets of ketchup with my large fries, and while that may be a heavy ketchup to fry ratio, some people LIKE A LOT OF KETCHUP. And we should not be made to feel inappropriate for asking for more.Don't worry, your ketchup supply is safe, as I won't be back : )"

The line wasn't THAT long, it was long but they have it under control and sped it up pretty fast. Its my turn to order, AND THERE'S A FUCKING FACE by the menu. What the hell talk about super catching my ass off guard. Apparently the person taking your order looks at you thru a camera. The one thing that made it that more awkward was the girl that was taking my order, her eye balls were bout to come out of her socket, she looked like a damn pug ( I'm not even lying it scared the shit out of me ) So I ordered the spicy chicken burger and the boyfriend got the basic chicken burger. We get our food and decided to eat in the shade on one of the cutty streets by Highland. What the hell was I looking at. Not only did it taste like a food stamp chicken burger but it also looked like it. The cheese looked all rubbery and old.  The waffle fries were all soggy.

The crispy chicken is good but only in moderation.3) Peach milkshake!! It's seasonal. I waited in line for an hour the day this CFA opened just so I could have one! The ice dream is of course to die for as well. Can't wait til the holiday season, when the mint-chocolate flavor goes online!4) About the breakfast minis (which look HILARIOUS on the website menu): the bread is sweet!!  The hash browns (which are more like flattened tater tots) are good -- no sogginess or greasiness.5) On the day this CFA opened, I went over at 9am for breakfast -- I got my picture taken with a cow. I loved that, even after the camera crews left, the cows stood around quietly dancing the whole time! It was unbelievably cute.  I went back for lunch, and the line at that hour was scary-long. But the drive-through line was even more ridiculous. With gas at $4/gal, you'd think people wouldn't mind chucking a few coins in the meters and walking over, instead of stopping traffic on Sunset Blvd?

This was actually my first time here and I have to say their chicken was the best quality fast food I have ever had.Their Spicy Chicken Sandwich and Chicken Nuggets were simply WOW! It was like I was transported to a five star gourmet Mcdonalds. Still being fast food I feel their chicken may or may not be fresh, but they sure do make a great imitation of fresh. Their chicken was so juicy and fried to a perfect crunchy crisp. And their Chick-Fil-A sauce was so much better then any bbq sauce. Drizzle a little on your sandwich and bam!!! So bomb!!!Top off your food with their really good milkshakes and you have the perfect fast food meal. I cannot wait for the Northridge one to open so I can go everyday!"

The fact that they haven't been open for a week and are this efficient is a great way to establish yourself, so props to the management on that front!Unlike every Chick-fil-a I have been to, this one has no inside seating. Instead, there is a large outdoor patio that allows you to people-watch the colorful people of Hollywood.  I was encouraged to see the restaurant has two armed guards on the premises just outside the dining area.  This area of LA isn't necessarily the safest and having a strictly outdoor restaurant could be an issue, but it is refreshing to see CFA has thought of that and added the piece of mind of having these guards present.Finally, the food was delicious as always.  For me CFA, sets itself apart from other fast food locations in offering a wide variety (at least 7) of dipping sauces that are self-serve and do not charge you extra for.It is great to see another CFA location in LA!"

But I get through and have my large order in my hand at 11:30...YEA. Fast.Chick-fil-a definitely knows how to keep control of a crazy situation and they had A LOT of hands on deck. Oh yea.

It was delicious, as always. I had the chicken biscuit with tater tot meal and got the chicken biscuit minis for my girlfriend who had never had Chick-fil-A. She thought they were delicious. I have mostly given up fast food because the quality of most places are so low and the food just does not taste good to me anymore, after trading for healthier options. But Chick-fil-A is still delicious and still a quality product, unlike McDonalds or Burger King where everything is wilted or over cooked and processed tasting. Another notable thing about this location is that everyone who worked there was super friendly and seemed really excited about the opening and working there, which is another thing that is unusual, compared to other fast food places. Most LA fast food places the employees either are completely dismissive to you or look at you like you are the cause of their miserable existence. Not to mention, if they give you food that is smashed and not edible, (ahem, Burger King) the manager will actually debate you and give you attitude rather than simply giving you something fresh and properly prepared. And not only were the people at Chick-fil-A helpful and polite, but it's the first fast food joint I've been to in LA where the staff was attractive and seemed like they went to college. My server looked like she could be on the CW and was super sweet. It's the first time I've been to a fast food place in LA where I actually felt like I was in the South, where people are polite, helpful and cute and SMILE. Not that fast food servers need to be cute, but if almost every store you went to in LA the people looked haggard, miserable, depressed and never smiled, it would make you depressed too. In fact, this was probably my only fast food experience in LA where they smiled not once but several times and didn't look like they hated their life and me for existing, and had to go home later to feed their five kids they don't like that much. It's nice to finally have some good customer service, plus quality in LA where I don't have to pay an arm and a leg to get it."

And furthermore, there was an employee walking down the line handing out food to cars rather than having them wait to pull up to the window which seemed fine initially. But what was happening is the the car at the window must've been waiting for their food for 10 minutes while other people behind them us included were just sitting there and couldn't go anywhere.

The cheese tasted processed; I do not know why but the cheese made the sandwich inedible for my taste preferences. (1 out of 5 stars)My husband, fortunately, ordered two chicken sandwiches without cheese and let me have one of his sandwiches. Having the sandwich without cheese made all the difference (3 out of 5 stars without Chick-fil-A sauce, 4 out of 5 stars with Chick-fil-A sauce).Lastly, the fries I felt were on the lower end of fast-food fries.

Of course the food is always good and fresh and sometimes the line is long ( especially during covid as we can't go inside and all chik fil as' have long drive throughs in the LA area). It's not long lines all the time though and they move pretty quickly. I unfortunately had a bad experience on my last visit and I called when I got home. I spoke with Michelle and she told me to come back the next day and speak to a manager. The next day I went when I got off of work and the employees were kind and patient and didn't mind getting the manager for me. The manager on duty came out ( Justin the director) he was instantly friendly and it even showed on his face so his friendliness was authentic. His voice is very encouraging and he listened to my experience. What I appreciate about Justin is that he didn't make any excuses, he immediately apologized and gave some suggestions as to what would work to make up for the experience I'd had. He got the deed done very quickly and he was just so friendly and understanding, he's also very humble and has great customer service. He's literally the reason I'm going to go back to this location. Thank you so much for you excellent customer service Justin, you are appreciated!"

Originally I paid the person who took my order in line on the ipad. When I got to the drive-thru window Joseph, the cashier, stated that my payment did not go through. I was looking through my bank statements and saw two charges, one for $9.32 and another for $28.03! I am a single person who ordered a 3peice meal. I called chick-Fil-A cares twice and left feedback on their website, nothing was done. I continued to follow up but still nothing. Thankfully, I was finally able to find my receipt in my car and called the chick-fi-la location regarding my issue. I spoke to Erik, the manager, and he stated that in order to receive a refund I would need to come to the location w/ the same card that was used for the transaction, in addition to the receipt. So on top of their mistake I am responsible for pursuing the refund. When I arrived Erik, the manager, seemed as if I was inconveniencing him. He suggested that he was refunding the $9.32 - absolutely not, you charged me $28.03 in addition to the meal I ordered, which the original meal was only $9.32! The fact that I had to go out of my way (late for work) to retrieve a refund on behalf of their mistake is so tiring and the constant following up that I am still doing is time consuming.

I didn't double check the sandwich thinking it was fine.. got to work and it wasn't a spicy grilled sandwich.. it was a grilled club sandwich.. why make me wait 10 mins if you were going to give me any sandwich you felt like? You could have just grabbed something that was already ready. I'm also 8 months pregnant and had already driven back to work and made the 10 min walk from my car to my office by the time I figured this out... so I got to eat what they picked for me. and also didn't have pickles on it... big problem when that's all you want pregnant . And the bag sticker and the receipt allll showed my correct order. Literally every time I go to chick fil a there is a problem and my order is messed up.

He waited, and even the security guard told him it was okay to enter. He still waited. I waved again for him to go ahead of me. Finally he did. After I finished ordering for my family, the server said that the man in front of you just paid for your meal. I was shocked and also realized I had ordered for four!  I got out of my car (mask on of course!) and tried to return the money to him. He would not take the money. He just smiled and said (mask on of course!), ""Be safe and enjoy your meal."" Then I noticed his scrubs, and said a prayer for this young doctor who had just finished his shift. I literally cried because here was this first responder who was still giving even after his long day. Thank you to the doctor whose kindness shone brightly in this pandemic.

Unfortunately the app is a complete piece of garbage and after 20 minutes of refreshing and trying different emails they are unable to confirm my email and as a result I can't submit an order via the app. After dealing with this issue for 30+ minutes I decided that I will just never spend another dollar at this location because they seem uninterested in providing the customer with even basic customer service. My money should have been refunded after the issue was brought to their attention and if I was kind enough to come all the way back to allow them to ""make it right"" they should have done everything possible to do that."

The manager, Joseph, gave us a disgusting attitude (which is VERY rare for this company) and insinuated we wanted a free meal. We paid $20 for two meals and we did not have any interest in scamming the company for a $10 meal. The drive thru lady left our bag of food on the table and walked away. Nobody apologized, but they embarrassed us in front of other customers. We did not mirror their rudeness. We simply grabbed our food and left. This type of behavior should NOT be allowed.

Clearly and carefully, I ordered a grilled club sandwich combo meal with a smaller diet frozen lemonade. When I got to the drive-thru window I found out that they gave me a large diet lemonade, and I asked them to change it for the smaller. I'm diabetic and can only handle so much carbs and sugar, and the diet frozen lemonade isn't calorie-free. Having a smaller portion keeps me from cheating and having too much. I didn't care about the money difference, but they insisted on crediting my bank card. A whole whopping $0.33!  But then no one seems to know how to do a credit on the machine and I had to wait further for a manager to come over and fix it.But then I noticed that they had given me a grilled chicken sandwich and not the grilled chicken club. You'd think that after this long wait they would simply fix it, but no, they insisted on charging me the $1.75 extra. So, for a 3rd time I hand over my bank card, to a manager who obviously didn't want to be friendly or helpful. Problem is they charged me again for the cheese... because the grilled sandwich they gave me before DID, surprisingly, have cheese on it! It was just missing the correct bun and the bacon. To test them, I pushed my finger into the underside of the bottom bun. All this while, the drive-thru went from 2 cars behind me to more than 10.And of course, when I finally got a sandwich back, all they had done was add bacon to it, since it already had cheese. I also know they didn't make it fresh because the bun was still the same one as before... with a finger hole in the bottom. And it was completely cold. So, $1.75 to have bacon added and have the chicken not even be a little bit warm...since it was the same piece. Greeeeeaaat.On top of all that, the re-made frozen lemonade was not a diet one, and I know this because when I got home my sugar levels were way off... not what I had planned for! Luckily my diabetes isn't very serious because this could be dangerous for someone else.Just sloppy work, and attitude to boot. Why am I being given attitude when I'm being polite about mistakes THEY MADE? So much for ""my pleasure""...which I didn't hear once!"

I don't quite remember when this incident happened but I dined in because parking there is horrible , as all of y'all may know.  I go inside and my order is taken by Arianna the sweetest one out of all of them , along with this other girl with glasses , don't quite remember her name. I didn't have problems there until I received my food. It was NOT fresh , the fries were COLD, SALTY and they had the nerve to not top them off. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to make it a big deal, so I sat down and I start eating. (Btw off topic the restrooms are disgusting as well) I notice that these two young ladies are waiting for the food , it was 20 minutes , it was not packed , they asked about there order and they were told it was placed in the mobile holding area. They get upset and say they they have been standing there nobody has called them. A girl by the name ""molly "" YELLS from the back and says "" I YELLED YOUR NAME 6 TIMES AND NOT ONCE DID SOMEONE RESPOND"" this girl did not yell 6 times nor did she care to go look for this customer ( it was not packed at all ) then of course the two young ladies respond to the employee and now mind you we have a chick fil A employee yelling from the back arguing and fighting with a customer in the dining area . I was so disgusted seeing this situation because Daniel the manager ( I've seen him and encountered him a couple of times) was just standing there counting money , allowing his employee yell from across the room to this customer. That's beyond unprofessional and disrespectful to the people who are just trying to enjoy their chicken sandwich. Daniel being the manager says nothing to the customers nor "" Molly"" who arguing with the customer  back and forth . There is the manager for you , the one that are suppose to care about the customers. The second incident was with this young ""supposedly "" manager "" Grace"" who shouldn't be one , she doesn't have the patience to help someone, always seems bothered when asked for something. I was carrying out this time (Wednesday of last week) ""molly"" hands me my food , this time she wasn't insane like last time but I get COLD FRIES AGAINNNNN !!! With no sauce. I said something this time. I notice this girl ""Grace"" who I didn't know her name at the time, I let her know what happened and she walks away from me , not saying a word and mouth something under breath , I noticed because the other employees looked at me and laughed. She came back and handed me new fries and said "" YOU CAN KEEP THE OLD ONES, ANYTHING ELSE"" like  if you don't want to work there leave . So disrespectful. And she is in charge , that's scary . Seems like she can't handle pressure. I respond to her and say , if it isn't any trouble can I get my sauces , she says "" WHAT WERE THEY"" all rude , I thought chick fil A was suppose genuinely love to help people and go that extra mile but I guess not, they hire people who want to work for free and just stand there observing holding a clipboard and assigning people where to go. I don't have this problem in the morning , I've encounter Catherine and Cesar who they truly love helping and they make sure that the customers eat what they payed for . That's amazing ( something is wrong with the night) They need fire all management and hire people who love to help, like Arianna should be a manager there. I'm offended by their actions. ( NEVER GO THERE AT NIGHT) I don't even want to meet the operator , she is probably self centered and disrespectful like these three that I've encountered."

I have been eating chick fil a since i was 3 years old I am 33. I ate at this location and got food poisoning so bad i vomited blood and had diarrhea for 12 hours. I know it was this food because I was dieting with only protein bars and smoothies prior for weeks. I had to get 2 IVS vomited blood and I work for the best doctors in the country and they all confirmed it was E COLI poisoning. SAVE YOUR OWN LIFE.

Employees chatting with each other about the shots they took the night before, massaging each other, demonstrating new dance moves, clocking out for lunch, looking for their name tag, and jumping up and down. Yes, I've experienced all this at this location. 15 minutes I waited for a cold chicken sandwich. If you don't believe me, you don't have to take my word for it.

The layout is too tiny for the congested corner so be aware you will surely wait in a line for at least 15 minutes for drive through. And even if you want to park and go in to save time, forget about it. The drive through lines are so long around the parking lot that you have to wait just to get to the parking spots. Horrible system for getting customers in and out. I was also pretty disappointed with the food itself. The sweat tea and chicken were okay but the fries were overcooked. :(On the positive, the staff are very friendly and helpful!"

This has got to be the worst Chick-fil-A regarding customer service. Placed a breakfast order and turns out that right after me there was another person named just like me. A few minutes later a male chick-fil-a employee walks up to the other customer and hands him a bag. That customer looks through the bag and immediately realizes that wasn't what he ordered. He walks up to the counter to inform staff, turns out it's the manager, and informs her that he was given the wrong order. I can see the manager checking the order and then realizing that their was 2 Danny's. She informs the male employee of the mistake and I can see him laughing like it's not a big deal. A few moments later the same male employee walks up to me and hands me a bag. I look through the bag he has given me the other Danny's bag. I immediately grab his attention and inform him that he has made a mistake again and that he has given away the wrong food bag again. He turns around angrily, snatches the bag out of my hand and yells out, ""You're not the only Danny in here so you need to relax."" Which I reply with, ""I know. That's why you need to make sure you're handing out the right bag. You already made the mistake once why not double check?"" He then gives the bag to the other Danny and walks behind the counter. I immediately notify the manager of what just occurred and while doing so I can see the same employee staring at me as if he's trying to intimidate me. I've been to several Chick-fil-A's and I have never seen an employee act so rudely. After leaving the restaurant with my food I look it up on Yelp and I begin to read all the bad reviews regarding customer service at this location."

I visit this location frequently because it is not only the closest to my home, it is on my route to work. Today was the final straw for me. This morning i ordered a chicken, egg, and cheese muffin with an egg white... it took them over 10 minutes to give me just a single sandwich. I asked to speak to the manager - Joseph - is his name and I politely spoke to him about the frequent extended wait times and how this was unacceptable. His response was that she - referring to the woman who is expediting the orders - did not see my order because it was buried within all the small orders. I took this as an insult I worked in the restaurant industry for more than three years, I am more than familiar with the process - this is disrespectful to tell a customer that your team is simply not doing their job and there is no solution to this problem. When I asked how he planned on implementing changes and compensating his customers - he told there was nothing else he could offer me. It's disrespectful and a poor excuse of a chick fil a. Like myself, one of the main reasons people frequent chick fil a, is the service and this location does not even come close to the standards and precedent set by other locations. I have not decided if I will return."

Only problem is the line is always big, same as in & out burger. I don't like long lines, big surprise there . Finally when I knew they were closing soon I went to try my luck. Line was a bit long but I was on a mission. 15 mins later I got my order and drove straight home. Yes I dipped into the waffle fries and yes, they are really good! Different than any other French fry in both texture and taste, highly recommended. Once I got home 5 mins later it was game on. The holy grail of fast food chicken sandwiches was in my hands. Fresh bun I could feel, chicken was a substantial piece but not as big as I was expecting from all the pictures I've seen. Still plenty big enough to satisfy most hunger. I tried my first bite and waited... the heavens didn't open and no angels singing. Was a very good sandwich but not as good as the hype. I tried the dipping sauce, it's like a bbq sauce married thousand island. Which made a lovely child worthy of dipping anything really. Lastly was the mac n cheese...omg! So good! Seriously order it, tastes like a grandma from the south made it. Drooling just thinking about it.  Bottom line is the food is certainly worth the price but the wait? Not so much, so it may be some time before I return."

UNLESS CHIK FIL A IS ORGANIC AND PASTURED---BOTH OF WHICH ARE NOT THE CASE--WHY IS THEIR'S SO MUCH MORE???the fries were crisp and slightly spicy and good textured. did i also mention that they tasted goodthe mac n cheese was cheesey and slightly lumpy and actually tasted like mac and cheese not like some lab experiment.  the biscuits were tasty...also their regular fried chicken looked pretty tempting!!all in all...Popeye's is just better tasting and less expensive.i will not eat either again as i prefer actual fried chicken--thigh meat being my favorite....if i want a great chicken sandwich, i will buy a couple of thigh pieces at Gus's or Stevies and slather two slices of bread with mayo and a couple of pickles and --PRESTO---I HAVE THE BEST CHICK SANDWICH MONEY CAN BUY"

So it's my fault you guys failed and now I have to pay for it!! Apparently there is no more stuff left form breakfast! Yea right! I'm sure they have stuff in the back and they could have given me my stuff and everyone in the store knew I was pissed! Because the cashier girl stopped the useless manger Erica and told her something quietly and that's when she came to talk to me. FAIL! FAIL! FAIL! They suck! And to top it off she had the balls to open my food! One by one she opened my food! That's disgusting!! She shouldn't open my food like that or anyone's food! She should just believe the customer! I don't wanna eat the food when she's opening everything! That's nasty! I called corporate to complain and they said that they could only see d a message to the store to help me and I'm like what?? I just talked to them and they didn't help me at all!

I was visiting a friend at Cedars and decided to stop on my way back to OC... because hey it's chick-fil-a and why not. 1st of all what is w/the layout of this place? it is not parking friendly what so ever. it took 5mins to park and that was in a mostly empty lot. It's kind of strange because its has these secret back alley entrances. I was thinking am i here for nuggets or an illegal poker game.  once i got inside it was like organized chaos. idk if its because it's so new and everyone is still catching on, but the number of people waiting for help vs. the number of people working did not add up. no greeting. no body welcoming in the next guest in line. the young lady who took my order almost gave me a vibe that she was doing me a solid by taking my order. I stuck w/the number once since I am a creature of habit. I asked for it large size w/fries well done (yes it's a thing, and you can thank me later). I was charged, only to find out I did not receive the large size. rather then swipe again for the $.50 i decided to just rock the med drink and fries. the young ladies seemed put out that i asked her about the miscommunication. who knows maybe i did not say it loud enough the three times i mentioned... not like a crazy 3x like rain man... just repeating knowing that it probably wasnt not processing. my food was awful! fries were not well down, and my sandwich... i got the impression that there must have been a bag full of ready made sandwiches in a heat bag (don't tell my i'm crazy) because the bottom bun was moor like a bottom sponge then a bun. the chicken was soggy, the bun fell apart... and my heart broke as i attempted to merge onto the nightmare 10 freeway at 6pm on a Saturday night.  Send in the troop chick-fil-a its a beautiful store, and i'm sure the location will do well but i do not think i'll return until this location gets a little more stable... i guess it's back to mcdonalds."

Sat in drive thru for almost an hour waiting for breakfast only for me to get to the window for them to tell me breakfast is over. That wouldn't have been as bad, as the young lady in charge of changing the menu board over was unable to do so, which means I didn't know how to adequately pivot to a lunch option instead. I'm ordering lunch, staring at the breakfast menu. Now I know what you're thinking-- Ced why didn't you just get out of your car and go in? That's a valid question. There's a wall in front of the entrance on one of the drive through areas so you can't get to the entrance of the actual store. There's no signage to notify you of this either. Ultimately it feels like not only was the architect of this store slightly incompetent for the LA area it's in, it also feels like this store was opened too early to handle the traffic. No one was outside handling orders (which is the norm) and based on which entrance you use you can get to order quicker.This is the worst Chik-Fil-a I've been to thus far. Utter train wreck."

Second time i came i was in line for longer than thirty minutes, there was no one outside taking orders , people were trying to cut the line by coming into the parking lot from different entrances. Now here i am again at 7 in the morning and I've already been in line for twenty minutes and there's only two cars ahead of me.

Workers were outside assisting and taking orders, and the first thing out of my mouth is if they had the mac & cheese. I was granted a yes, and was finally happy I was trying this new side. Only about 4 cars ahead of me, there was a really long line after me, so I arrived at just the right time. Cashier Deazhane was Super-friendly, something I am not used to at the Hollywood location. Beaming, she calls you by name and asks how you are, and although other places do this as default, you can't help but smile back and reply in kind. Service was top and as for the food, everything was packaged accordingly, and I ended up finishing this in my car on the trip back up La Cienega. This location is right at the 10 freeway so watch for traffic during the busy times (which is often). Happy to have tried the mac & cheese (small portion for $2.79) and would for sure consider this again. Both associates I dealt with were friendly, something the other locations should learn from.

Being beyond disappointed, I called the store manager and she said I have to return for a refund when they should be able to process it in their POS system. I forgave the couple dollars but what shocked me is the manager said she apologized for the employees making mistakes that most of them do not have prior food handling experience!!!!

So whether you want to just go in and eat or use the drive through, you're going to be waiting in ONE LONG AND SLOW line. And unlike other Chick-fil-A's this line is not going smoothly. It does not go as fast As others seem too. So if you go here make sure you don't go when it's busy. And the entrance/exit on the La Cienega side is blocked so you can only leave from there.

James had came outside in a very upsetting behavior and starting going off on me. He had called me a theft and a liar about my request that I am stealing from the company. I didn't mind paying for the upgrade at all it's just the fact he belittled me in front of customers with his voice and tone. What I did was I paid for my food and just wanted to see if they can do it. If not, I would have paid for it. James is an complete embarrassment to all of chick fil a's location and he should never speak to a customer like that ever again. By far the worst chick fil a in all of Los Angeles.

Instead they told me to call customer service. Highly annoying! They need to get it together. I'm not going to this location anymore.

I have never been more consistently disappointed- in this review I'll detail my experiences from my two visits Monday and Wednesday mornings. I generally arrive around 10:10-10:15 on my way to work to grab breakfast. On Monday, I pulled into the drive through and although the line I happened to be in wasn't moving as fast as the other- I didn't mind waiting. But then I noticed an additional cashier appearing in the other line, and I watch as three to four cars that arrived after me have proceeded to make their way to leave. When I ask the closest cashier why there was two people assisting a line that's already exceeding the productivity of the other line? She just shrugged and said ""Idk what he's doing- he just came out here"" instead of taking the time to survey and assess the scene and communicate effectively with her co-worker. By the time I get to order it's after 10:30 and they refuse to serve me breakfast although I arrived in more than enough time to have ordered and left had they only been paying attention. On yesterday, Wednesday, I arrive and there's hardly any line and I'm thinking ""wheww- this finna be a breeze"" but as I'm waiting to order some male employee walks out and hands a drink to one of the female cashiers taking orders in the drive thru, and proceeds to begin a conversation with her. I don't think anything of it until I notice the drive thru cashier in my lane literally walks past my car- TO GO JOIN THEIR CONVERSATION! Then she proceeds to take the orders of cars behind me, completely forgetting me and my roommate who've been waiting nearly 15 mins at this point. What in thee actual fuck.. and it isn't until two cars have passed me in the left drive thru lane and cars behind me are honking that she walks up to my window and asks why I'm not pulling forward. She gets annoyed that I'm upset and rushes to take my order and doesn't even bother to ask for my name before she rolls her eyes and walks away.. I told an employee that I recognized from being on the inside a few times that always went out of their way to converse with me, that'd I never be returning and it was her that implored of me to write this. So yea, thanks for tarnishing my image of a brand that I formerly perceived to be the epitome of customer service.. fuck y'all"

So my next question was when will you have it because I found it very stupid to cut off products because someone didn't properly order inventory.

Prior, I had to go all the way to Sunset branch. However, like many other comments, I have to agree that the food is great, but the service is horrible. It seems like the drive-thru is run by bunch of teenagers that are too immature to hold a paying job. Although, I do not expect some sort of 5-start services at a fast-food restaurant, I do expect them to not get my order wrong, give an attitude, or make me wait while they are too busy flirting with themselves.

Yesterday around 3pm was just outrages and I must share the awful experience. I was working for Doordash and I was sent to pick up chick filet. The last 2 times the employees were rude and not helpful at all. I approach the women at the entrance and she tells me that they will call out my order when it is ready. I went to wait in my car and right away my order was called. I waved at the employee holding my order and she looked very unhappy to have to walk it 15 feet to my car. When she hands it to me she tosses it with attitude. And I mean disrespectful attitude. I proceed to ask her why she was acting this way. She said ""Your are supposed walk up and get it"" I said okay sorry but I didn't think it was a big enough deal for her to be rude. She then said ""Go fuck yourself"" and threw her arms up while walking away. The manager came out, who was very nice and even tried offering me a free drink. A customer in her car next to me even confirmed that the female employee had done what I said. Check the security tapes as well if you need further proof. This sort of service and disrespect I would expect from an inner city Taco Bell, but never from a Chick Filet, especially a new location in Hollywood. Regardless of anything, no employee should ever tell a customer/food courier to ""go fuck themselves"" just because they had to walk the food to my car. Not to mention, last time they asked us to wait in our cars. So it is very confusing. I just needed to share my experience, in hopes that this employee cannot continue to disrespect customers. I want to be clear that the manager was helpful and did his best. I love Chick Filet and they always have great service, but NOT at this location..."

Once i pulled up to the drive through, my friend and i were waiting on a ""hey can i take your order"" or a greeting of some sort to start our order. While waiting, my friend and i were having a good laugh amongst ourselves when we hear Leslie(male) say ""alright so are you guys gonna order or keep messing around. Im the manager and if you keep messing around im going to ask you to leave"" My friend and i quickly looked at each other in shock because of how rude he came at us. And this is chick-fil-a ""known for your ""great"" customer service."" Once pulling up to the window, he told us that he didnt appreciate what we were doing back there. I politely responded with ""we were having a good time amongst ourselves, we never heard a 'hey can i take your order' if not we wouldve immediately stopped and would begin ordering."" His response was ""i heard squeeky voices."" And i told him ""yes cause we were talking amongst ourselves, like i said, i was never greeted to begin ordering."" He cut us off rudely said to forget about it and walked away. I definitely did NOT like the way i was treated. He belittled us and made my chick-fil-a experience one of my worst and will be one of my lasts. This is coming from a ""guest"" who is a daily buyer. You guys seriously need to figure out who it is you are hiring because for him be in a manager position and treating people like that is not right for your image."

Today I'm giving five stars because my wife and I got out of work early to spend time with our daughter, but our original choice was closed due to renovation (lemon tree on western). Daughter is super upset and disappointed, crying her eyes out and where do we go? We thought maybe McDs would be good plan B since they have a playground, but no their play place closes at 6. More disappointment! So we were ready to give up and decided to just order drive thru, but wife recommends chick fil a because she's preferred a chicken than a burger. So we go to the drive thru, and baby is still crying (she's two), and we're thinking of what to do at home to entertain her, when suddenly wife glances into the windows and sees kids running around and just gets out of the car, pulls our daughter and walks inside. I finished the order at the drive thru, parked and went inside, when to my delight I find my wife watching our daughter playing happily in chick fil a playground. THEY HAVE A PLAYGROUND! And she's happy! Wife is happy and with an appetite and I'm happy and really hungry, but at least we have chick fil a to thank for saving our Monday night. We're so glad you guys opened here. Food has been great, service is ridiculously good, and..... you have playground. What more can I say?"

Its a little bit of a drive, but it is closer than the sunset store (see you soon Sunset). The store is highly disorganized. FOH management is invisible. The management would do well to visit the Pasadena store. I have visited the store 9 times. With each visit, there was something wrong with my order. The offenses ranged from lying that the fries were crispy (cold and floopy) to missing sandwich to cold sandwich. I accepted each with a nod to the ""Just Opened"" god. Tonight, I stopped by for two cookies and a Sweet Tea. The counter person asked my name and asked ""Dine-in or Carry-Out"". I responded and then ordered. He typed for several moments, I handed him my money, he took it and then said, ""What would you like"". I had stood there for one minute for him to type a seven-letter name and select the ""TOGO"" button.Ten minutes later, I'm home, reading a book and excited for the cookie. The cookies are DAY OLD.

The manager which I believe he was, he told him to get out of there  that this was his store in a very humiliating and arrogant way. I do understand the issue of homeless we have going on all over the city but we can't be heartless when someone is hungry. I'm very happy the Chick-Fil-A came to our community and I will not let one issue to ruin the fact that many of us were waiting  for this business to come this way but definitely as member of this community I will ask kindly to the manager to be more kind. There are always ways in how to approach people. Remember we are all Christians and having a little of kindness in your heart will not destroyed the business. I could give you a 5 for the food but I will give you a 3 because I believe it is very important that business from our community care. (By the way, this happened on Friday around 6:30 p.m.)... thank you!"

We were promptly greeted by one of three team members ready to take our our order. And since we opted to dine in, we made our way to  one of the many booths available. During the course of our meal one of the employees came by to check on us and offered to refill our drinks. All in all this is going to be my go to location since it has ample parking compared to the Sunset location and a plenty of seating inside the restaurant."

The staff  at United Mix are pleasant but this Chik Fil A is literally the slowest and most inaccurate that I have ever experienced. I literally have to order 45 mins in advance and usually when I arrive the order is missing items so I still have to wait. I would advise you to order elsewhere unless you have a ton of time to waste.

And then get this, I ordered a spicy deluxe meal and once it was delivered, what I received was a regular spicy chicken sandwich, not what I paid for and ordered.It's definitely worth it to go down the street to the Water Tower location--save yourself from this terrible location."

I despise coming here. If it wasn't next door to my house, I would never ever come back to this location. Not at all up to Chick-fil-A standard. So disappointed. Go to Chicago and Wabash to the other location if your expecting the normal service. Last visit, my order was drenched in coke after waiting 25+ minutes. The food is either cold or old."

5,/biz/chick-fil-a-chicago-10?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Chicago,1 star rating,4/17/2020,Do not go here!!!  There are many other Chick Fil a locations who all offer wonderful food and service. This is not one of them. Ordered a simple delivery from here (2 sandwich meals). Food arrived ok (cold) but that wasn't the issue - they forgot all the sauces. So accidents happen okay but when I called to ask what can be done I was first passed around to 4 employees who all said they were the manager (??) and then told that since the order is through an app they won't help or do anything at all about it. So that was a nice 30 dollars down the drain courtesy of these geniuses. Save your money for another chick fil a

It is a ghost kitchen location which would make me think it's more efficient or faster, but no.

The food order on the other hand: extremely disappointing, subpar, incorrect, and cold, which is baffling and quite frankly suspicious, considering how quickly it arrived. It makes me wonder if I was given old food that had been sitting out. Gross. The chicken sandwich was supposed to have cheese. Nope. It was also cold, and the bun was soggy/disintegrating as if the chicken had been sweating on it for a while. The fries were ice cold, with no sign of warmth whatsoever.  I might as well have taken them straight out of the fridge to reheat. The side salad came without the dressing. The chicken strips were also cold, along with shriveled and rubbery. There is no chance these hadn't been sitting out for quite a while. They did not look like they had been made anytime in the last 8 hours.  I ordered a lemonade. Would this be the saving grace?  Nope. Somehow I was given a blue powerade (??? Aside from both drinks ending in ade, how does this get confused?) The main reason I even ordered from here was for the lemonade, and now I am really wishing I had ordered elsewhere. I have cold, questionable food, and the one item that I do feel comfortable eating without fear of food poisoning is the side salad, that came sans the side of dressing I ordered. I have ordered delivery from Chick Fil A in the past, and it was a good experience, which makes this all the more disappointing. I will say that the side sauces I ordered were all there, and that is why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1."

Have done delivery and it has worked out fine but the pick up took forever. It's not a chick-fil-a, it's ""humboldt park eatery"" that's essentially a pick up space that looks like a store front, with lockers, tablets to order, and a vending machine. My order took at least ten minutes from when I clicked ""I'm here"" on the online order that I placed. I guess it might be good if you want multiple restaurants for pick up? But I'm general it's a really weird vibe and shouldn't really be labeled as a chick-fil-a."

The lady that greeted me was nice but then a gentleman took over who seemed nice and asked me to wait outside and I will be texted when my order was ready. 30 minutes later I went back in and asked again about my order, he proceeded to explain how to scan to check in, he forgot we had already met and that I was already checked in. He found my order on a shelf and handed it to me. Well, the food was warm, and I was at the location for an hour. Well, not coming back here.

When I entered the establishment there were few customers in line so I should've been quick. Not one person greeted me, and as I waited for my food I noticed a bag on the counter. Because it was so small I knew it had to be mine. My issue is that no one called out the mobile order so I'm looking at my food just sitting on the counter getting cold. When she finally picked up the bag to run it out to the car I asked was it for me and she responded yes. I said to her "" I have been looking at my food sitting on your counter for almost 5 minutes and ur telling me it's going to be hot and fresh"" the employees response was "" I honestly don't know""... mind you I worked a chick fil a Lombard location for 3 years.

One day I was waiting for my food and wanted to wash my hands. The woman's bathroom was closed for cleaning so I decided to use the men's to quickly wash my hands. Obviously you need a code for the bathroom which was on my receipt. The security wasted no time following me in the bathroom aggressively telling me I'm not allowed to be in the men's bathroom. I tried to explain I was only washing my hands but he ignored me and continued to yell. I later asked a worker and she said I was not allowed to be in the men's bathroom, but the way she spoke she had brushed me off in a rude way. I understand I was in the wrong for thinking I could use the men's bathroom to wash my hands, I understand that now.

Let me preface by stating how excited I was to get a serving of Chick Fil A. After moving to bfe California, where the nearest Chick Fil A is like 40 mins away, I was looking forward to this meal. It'd been so long that all of my rewards had expired on the app. Sadness, I know. First, there is no designated Chick Fil A curbside parking outside the store so you literally have to just block traffic. Second, I didn't request that my order be started until I arrived yet EVERY item arrived lukewarm, fries HALF full (both orders upgraded to a large and we could fit both of our fry orders into one fry holder), and sandwich bread was soggy. Additionally, one of the drinks requested no ice. It was 3/4 ice. I would have taken pictures but, the whole impeding traffic thing kinda made me in a rush to get out of the street. I have NEVER had a poor experience at Chick Fil A before-- I honestly don't even know how to process this lol What is life when Chick Fil A gets it wrong???"

After walking around before heading to rest we were hungry and ready for a quick dinner. Tons of places to eat in Chicago but we were tired and for the first time during my trip we just wanted some fast food. McDonald's is next door but come on it's chick fil a ! No comparison :-). The line was pretty long but the staff did a great job at keeping things moving. Despite the amount of people they were serving the cashiers were smiling and pleasant calling next in line and answering the many questions people tend to ask about the basic menu lol. Our food came out fast. You don't even take a number they just call your name for you to grab your order and then there were plenty of places to sit even with it being crowded. No sticky/dirty tables when looking for a spot so that's always a plus. Back home in Cali the two locations I go to if you order to eat in they bring it to your table and on the tables each table even has a small vase with REAL flowers. And then someone is usually walking around cleaning as people are coming and going and asking everyone if they need anything like more sauce. More like a restaurant I know I didn't realize how much they were going above and beyond until now. It was just different coming here but I mean it's fast food if you want a waitress/waiter you go to a restaurant :-).

Yesterday I went to this location because I was in the area and had been feigning for this location(I think its the best). But I was really saddened that they wouldn't take my money. I had made a purchase, sat and ate but I want more to take home to the kids. Yet I was told they don't take bills over twenty dollars. I had NEVER heard such a thing. But what more could I do, I left WITHOUT the sandwiches I wanted. Not sure if I'll return. As much as I hear ppl talk bad about @chick-fil-a    ..... I always say ... forget that, I'm going to get me some chick-fil-a ....and that ice cream . Please. I love that ice cream as much. Then I still go ALL the way down town Chicago to get some.

I've been staying in Chicago all week, and have been there twice, once for lunch and once for breakfast. When I went, the facility was clear, modern, and comfortable. The staff were extremely friendly. They answered all of our questions (as were from Michigan and we only have been to Chick-fil-a once before) and we received our order very quickly. The food was fantastic, the employees were terrific, however the manager made me very uncomfortable. We went this morning for breakfast (Monday, January 2nd, 2017) around 10:30 in the morning. We ordered our food, quickly received it, and then sat down and began to eat. As we were eating, an African American man came in wearing beats head phones, and nice clothes, with a backpack, and began to walk around the restaurant looking for a seat to set down his things to go order. The (assumable) manager (White) went up to the man and began to forcefully ask him why he was in her restaurant, and said ""asking people for money in our restaurant isn't allowed,"" the man looked astonished, he simply said he wasn't and proceeded to go up to the counter to order his food. As he walked up to the counter, the manager made a motion to an employee to keep an eye on the man. My father and I both saw the incident happen, and I was upset but I didn't say anything until the next incident happened. The employee was friendly to him. The man got his food and left the restaurant. Another African American man had come in when my father and I had just sat down to eat and he had left his phone and went outside to smoke a cigarette. When he came back in, the manager went up to him and in a really rude way, yelled at him saying that he can't do that. The man simply said I'm sorry, and went and took a seat. The manager also yelled at an employee who was working hard and cleaning tables after we were finished eating.At this point I was really astonished so I asked my dad if he saw that, and he said yes. I, personally don't think that the yelling was needed at all. I personally think the woman was being extremely racist towards the two men, because the first man was dressed in nice clothes, and had done nothing that made my father or I think of him as suspicious. For the second man I realize you shouldn't leave your things inside, but yelling isn't needed. I would eat here again, but I would definitely avoid the manager."

Anything you order here is high quality for fast food. I randomly get cravings for chick-fil-a nuggets and could probably eat 20 at a time if I didn't have any self control. It is on the pricier end of fast food, but the service is very personalized (they call customers by name) and they will do anything to be loyal to customers. On my last visit, after a 13 hour shift I was tired, starving, and craving some yummy peanut oil nuggets. I ordered a 12 piece meal, but when I got home, realized they only gave me 8. It was fine, but in my hunger driven sadness, I wrote a customer review to them online just so they were aware (and I wouldn't have to be sad for it happening again). Not only did they respond to my email, the store manager called my personal number and offered me a free 12 piece meal that could be redeemed at any time and would never expire. The sincerity of her apologies made me feel bad.. it was just four nuggets! That just goes to show how great of customer service they have. This is why I love chick fil a!"

After a few seconds of silent, stunned disbelief, I asked, ""Can we PLEASE have more than that?""

This was so nice, and I really was not even upset about the wait at all. Then she told me to sit and asked if I wanted the grilled nuggets while I waited.

My wife tried their chicken nuggets in Atlanta's airport and she liked it; so we decided to try their chicken sandwich in their location in Chicago.     At first sight it looked delicious and everything looked fresh so I was happy. But the taste was so salty compared to their many competitors that I wondered what was all the hype about. Don't get me wrong their chicken was pretty good (Real Chicken Breast) but I couldn't really enjoy it because it was so salty. If they pay more attention to there customers salt intake and health then I think this fast food chain will be alot better.

Their food is alittle bit more expensive than other fast food, but you are paying for that FRESH, fast food experience. Another huge difference you will see is that their employees are beyond friendly, and if they occasionally make a mistake, they go above and beyond to make it right.

God I love that girl. Ever since I've been a convert.

The food is just as good and the place is well run and service is very friendly but there is something to be said for keeping places regional, it kind of makes it more fun.The above being said if you are craving a chicken sandwich this is the place to get it, crispy and tasty. After some extensive personal research I have to say Chick-Fil-A is better then any of those over priced chicken places popping up in all the""hipster"" neighborhoods. Chick-Fil-A doesn't have to smoke it, sous vide it and triple 4 day marinade it to make it taste great, plus they don't charge you $12 for just a leg and a thigh. Waffle fries are my fav and they're good here but not always as crispy as I like, still tasty though. Everything taste better dipped in one of the many sauces they offer and don't be shy asking for a selection, they're happy to dish them out. Polynesia, ranch and buffalo are my fav but if you like smokey try the Chick-Fil-A sauce.It was not busy the day we went, which happened to be New Years day, correct we had no resolution to remove fried food from the diet. They do offer some order a head no wait mobile thing if you suspect there might be a line. Great chicken sandwich and fires if you want to feel hip get a tattoo of a chicken and a $$$ with the cash you saved."

(Place your order on app, drive up to store, employee brings your food to your car). My sister loves this app.- They do such a great job of creating tender chicken pieces. Every Time. Their chicken is so good even my picky nephew will clean his plate.- SO many sauces!!! All tasty!!! For free!! Do not forget about their plethora of sauces!!- Very friendly service. Probably the best service you'll ever get at a fast-food joint.- You can choose pickles or no pickles! Love that.- They have both grilled and fried chicken, spicy and non-spicy options. Cons:- Sometimes I feel like their food could use a little more... something...? I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm not ordering the right chicken sandwich. I know that it's fast-food. I know. But the lettuce is always so flat. I often feel like I'm just eating a bun and a piece of chicken, no matter how many other things I have them put on it. I would rather take home the bare chicken sandwich and add my own lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, and more. When i do that, it's delicious. When I don't, it's a $4 bun with chicken.- Today we went and our order placed on the mobile app didn't go through, so we ended up waiting at least 15 minutes for our food because we had to re-order everything. That was not normal, but it was not fun.I always go to Chic-fil-A wanting to love it, especially because many of my friends and family are big fans. And I will say, their chicken is really really good. But I sometimes feel like I walk away feeling a little disappointed. I will still keep coming back - I want that free cookie! But... we'll see what happens next.PS: Street parking here is not all that plentiful depending on the time of day you go..."

I was finally able to place my order with Lauren.   She couldn't complete my order fast enough (with a little attitude).  I was instructed to step aside and when my order was completed, I would be called.  The line had continued to go longer with younger patrons kept coming in and  standing in line.  My name was called within an appropriate amount of time.  The dining area is large and have various tables available from counters to the communal tables.  The area is very bright with windows facing the street and that can be very interesting......I had the Chicken Sandwich Value Meal which included the waffle fries and a drink.  With the value meal, you have various options for a side, which is a nice option.  The meal itself was okay.  The chicken tasted what KFC's chicken used to taste like.  The fries were luke warm.  The ketchup packets, that you really need to beg for, are unable to be opened.I would consider trying this place again.  Hopefully, with better service and warm food."

The place does NOT discriminate against gays, lesbians, trans, whatever, that's just the CEO's views. If you don't like it, don't eat there, it's as simple as that.

Then one day, I was sitting in my car, when an employee offered me a chicken sandwich. What? In fact, I was several blocks away from this actual location. He tapped on my window and at first I thought this chick-fil-a dude is lost. I was really surprised when he handed me a chicken sandwich. First I was impressed that the sandwich was still hot. Those professional warming bags and sandwich wrap are efficient. What the employee was really promoting was the new app for ordering. The coolest feature I saw was that I could order from the app and do curbside delivery. That comes in handy in downtown Chicago with limited free parking options. It's like having a drive thru without really having one. The chicken breast was really tasty. Each one is hand battered and never frozen and you can taste the freshness. I was not a fan of the bun which I tossed. It seemed like one of those cheap ""Jewel brand"" hamburger buns but the chicken breast was delicious. Would I come here? I'm not sure because I really avoid corporate franchise fast food. Was I happy to taste the chicken? Yes  I was really impressed with the mobile app they were pushing. Technology can really drive a business and having an app where you can order, pay & choose a delivery/pickup option is really advanced. So it was smart for them to hit the pavement and promote the business. Hey I'm bragging about it now, so it worked marketing department. I just wish more people knocked on my car window offering me free food."

Chick-Fil-A provides quality chicken sandwiches.     The business is a private company, so lets just pull the wool over our ears and ignore the somewhat recent controversy with marriage laws. This is a review on the restaurant, not the parent companies beliefs or business practices.This was my first time ever eating at a chick fil a. I have heard they had delicious food, and after working a long shift at the Signature Lounge walking towards the Red line I noticed they were still open. Even though I eager to head home, My lizard brain stopped me in my tracks and made me look into the restaurant. For a being so late at night, the place was still moderately busy.  So I figured ""why not?"" and stopped in. I was surprised to see such a small menu at first. There isn't  any options that other  chicken strips, nuggets, or sandwhiches on the dinner menu. The breakfast menu looks incredibly sexy and I would love to come in again and try it sometime. But that's a different review for a different day. I ordered the Spicy Chicken deluxe meal with a strawberry shake instead of a soda.  My first intial opinon was that all ingrediants were bright, and looked fresh. It was a smaller sandwhich but it definitely looked much more appealing than the same sandwhiches you could order at another fast food joint.First bite...Wow. Just wow. it was an interesting experience, because its just a fast food sándwich, but my brain was caught off guard by how SOFT the entire bite was. It was delicious, and all of the flavors blended together well. The pressure cooked chicken titty was succulent and did not dissapoint. I didn't think it was very spicy either, which was fine. But that sandwich was a smooth as silk going down, and very fun to eat. The Fries left me hanging a little bit. They were definitely fresh, and salted right, but it wasn't what I wanted from a french fry. Is it weird to call a french fry boring? Because it left more to be desired. Kind of like that one friend that you try to get to participate in group activities, and then regret it once you realize that you were better off without him. Also, the staff was very polite and seemed to still have a little bit of their souls intact even though they worked at a chicken joint. I was eating alone and noticed them walk through the lobby at least twice the 20 minutes I was there. Pros:Clean, everything was so very cleanDa ChikkenThe owners cheesy smiles on the placard by the soda machine.Cons:I was still hungry after eating a $9 dollar meal (however I am a big guy, your results may vary) Mcdonalds Fries  still reigns supreme. But the waffle fries were definitely fresh when I ordered them. My honest opinion, the place is a guilty pleasure. If someone shouted the word ""CHICKEN!"" and you had to write down the first 3 places that came to mind immediately, Chick-Fil-A wouldnt make the list. But if you were sitting around with friends and got to talking about it, you would definitely want to eat that over anywhere else."

The sauce was tasty too until I saw the ingredients but even then I was still eating it.And as I was eating, every couple minutes the guy who was cleaning came around to sweep.

Garbage cans were overflowing, flies were present at my table within minutes of opening  our food. Worst of all my 5 year old son slipped and fell in a puddle of urine in the men's washroom. The whole left side of his body was wet and smelled of urine. Disgusting!I sent my food back the minute I took a look at it .I was told all the tenders they had were from the same batch.

The dream went right to Brad Pitt and driving around with my best gal pal, blowing up the trucks of a-holes who don't know how to apologize. FUN. FUN. FUN.Part two:I tried Chick-fil-A for the first time. I'd always heard positive reviews, but I never had it. Of course Chick-fil-A came to my college after I left (if only I'd been on the 9 year plan...). While it's been in my general neighborhood for awhile...I just never made it there for one reason or another. But, all the stars were in alignment today.I had the original sandwich with waffle fries. In terms of fast food chicken sandwiches, Chick-fil-A's rules. RULES, I say. And the waffle fries have probably ruined other fast food fries for me. They have set the standard for ""fresh"", that's for certain. I am not sure when I will make it to Chick-fil-A again, but I'm already torn between getting the same sandwich, and trying something else. I hear the nuggets are something to behold.And here's another thing...every employee I saw there looked like they could work someplace else. I'm not used to that in fast food places. Everyone was so pleasant...and so...hygienic...and so...employable.... I'm glad Chick-fil-A is close to home, but not too close....if it was any closer, I'd eat there way too often, and, like Thelma's douchey husband, you'd be able to park a car in the shadow of my a$$.

Ordered the spicy chicken combo(sandwich/fries/drink)(under $8), told the cashier it was my first time & he hooked me up with his personal favorite sauces for dipping, which was cool. Got my food pretty quick, the chicken seem old i would scale it on the level of a McChicken. The waffle fries were fresh but lightly seasoned.

They always do deals so you can get anything from free ice cream to free 8-piece chicken nuggets to green lemonade on St. Patrick's Day!Most of the food is great. Lemonade is AMAZING. My personal favorites are the deluxe spicy chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets. ^_^ The waffle fries are good, too! Everything is good! I haven't tried the salads yet, though. Service is really impressive. Much faster and better than fast food competitors' in that they call the customers ""guests"" or ""clients"" and are highly efficient. They're nice and get the food ordered and out to you quickly. The place is so popular the line sometimes goes outside even with 10 people on registers!!!"

To my surprise and my son's disappointment when we got home and looked in the bag. Thanks Chick-fil-A. oh, and ordered 2 meals (about $11), only got 2 chick fil a dipping sauce. a little cheap on the sauce, eh? you think the yellow sauce was made out of gold or something they have to keep it behind the counter under constant guard."
243,/biz/chick-fil-a-chicago-9?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Chicago,3 star rating,8/16/2012,Maybe I just don't get it... Chick-fil-A was just OK and nothing more. I tried the waffle fries and spicy chicken sandwich. Neither were spectacular or especially standing out. Although I did like how the sandwich came in a separate bag to keep it warm. Perhaps the continuous hype is due to the lack of Southern fast food chains in the Chicagoland..... Perhaps I'm just a difficult person.... Because I'm certain I can find something similar at McD's and Wendy's.
244,/biz/chick-fil-a-chicago-9?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Chicago,5 star rating,8/15/2012,"I love Chick-Fil-A for so many reasons...  1.  I love that their employees have Sundays off.  I hate it on Sundays when I am craving a chicken sandwich, but love that their employees have a scheduled day off every week to spend with their friends and family.  Can't say that at most fast food places.  2.  The food is delicious and service is stellar.  I guess when you only do one thing (chicken) you really do it right.  It's simple, flavorful, and juicy.  It's 0.7 miles away and absolutely worth the walk every time.  My kids love it, too.  The staff actually look like they LOVE their job.  The employees work quickly, and always with a smile.  Get the lemonade, it's made fresh with real chunks of lemon pulp, and you get free refills.   3.  Kids night on Tuesdays.  If you have kids, it's awesome.  For every adult meal, you get a free chicken nugget meal for your child.  The meals usually come with a book, which I love.  I also like that the kids can get the squeezy applesauce instead of fries.  They have a nice craft table too, with 2 CFA staff members working with the kids, last night they made airplanes.  They let us trade our kids meal toy in for an ice cream, too, which the kids thought was cool.  (We got 2 of the same book anyway, so no I had no problem trading one in for ice cream.)  Before we left, in addition to everything else, the staff at the craft table even gave my kids a little stuffed cow.  They marched home shouting, ""Eat More Chicken!"" which is the CFA motto, and took those little stuffed cows to bed with them.  :)  Very happy children who loved the meal and experience, and cannot wait to go back.  4.  The Cow.  I have only seen the cow here on Kids Night, but wow, The Cow was WORKING IT!  My kids loved it.  He sat at our table, smelled the flowers on the table, tried to ""steal"" my 2 year old's applesauce.  He danced around like crazy, even going outside every now and then.  (It was awesome to watch the people passing by on the sidewalk react to The Cow!!)  The Cow was incredible, and adults as well as kids were enjoying his/her entertainment."

There are even several ingredients in their chicken sandwich and other items that come from oil refineries... I guess that qualifies as food somehow?  There are ingredients in it that are banned in Asia, Europe and other parts of the world... But not here in the good ole USA where corporate lobbyists control what we eat.Enjoy your cancer, Amercia!Every time you shop here, 15% of the sale, and 50% of the actual profit from this store goes to the bottom line of the corporate fascists that run Chick-Fil-A.The staff is friendly at this location, though."

I have never been to a Chick-Fil-A before, ever.  My first visit has left me kind of understanding all the hype about their food, but kind of not. Service was friendly but the sandwiches themselves were surprisingly small, like McDonald's-style small, had I been expecting too much for the price?  Probably I was, I don't know where I got the idea that Chick-Fil-A would be an economical choice.On to the positives - the chicken itself was definitely moist and flavorful, I generally avoid fast-food chicken because it often gets done up so wrong, but it seems that Chick-Fil-A has got that almost just right.  Ditto on the waffle fries, not too soggy or too stiff.I don't know if I will ever visit a Chick-Fil-A again, but if I do it won't be during the lunch rush hour.  Had I spent less wait time and less $$ I might be more enthusiastic about returning.  And there are plenty of other places in the city where I can spend the same money on a good meal without having to worry about the crass politics of the people who are profiting from my spending."

The inside is very nice and modern, the outside is cold looking, sterile. Work on that. The staff is very friendly and the service is quick as to be expected at a fast food joint. Like I said, I wanted to test this place, so after my class at Loyola, I biked over here, got the Chicken pieces, 4 sauces, fries & cole slaw and went to the gym. Then I stuck my food in the locker while I worked out, for 1.5 hours. Then I biked home and ate it. It was still good. Well done Chick-fil-A. Chicken - Better than the McDonalds, wendys, arbys Burger king noise.Waffle Fries - These were OK, I reserve judgement because I let them sit awhile, and fries don't like that. Cole slaw - nothing to write home about, but they give you a lot. Saw says. (sauces) =Buttermilk ranch - oh yes creamier than snow whites thighs. Polynesian - really awesome. Cross between sweet & sour but not gross. Bbq sauce - least favorite. Too sweet, not enough smoky. Better than all the other fast food BBq sauces tho.Cheese sauce - this was new and the cashier said it was really good. When I ate my food it was so long after I ordered it I forgot what this was. When I first tried it, I thought it was butter. I am not complaining mind you. Overall, best fast food experience I have had in awhile. Give them a shot."

Every time, I get a #1 with NO PICKLES (I need it to have a bun, I can't do the nuggets) and they have never once given me a pickle. Until it came here I used to just stare longingly at the closed one in the Florida airport, since I was always there on Sundays by some horrible twist of fate. Now I can have it whenever I want and I'm still way excited by it because... it's Chik Fil A. In Chicago. What? I need to go there for breakfast.I try not to let the politics get in the way of my fried chicken. Also, their waffle fries need more salt."

Interesting. Mind you trying to serve 100+ guests the food will get cold so I didn't get a full on taste of what Chick-fil-A had to offer.Well, the other week myself and two workers stopped by before and meeting and trying to be on a ""healthier"" binge I was super excited to see the 4 piece grilled chicken nuggets, score! NOT! 4 meager pieces of grilled chicken nuggets that weren't even bigger than the size of my thumb! Both my co-workers were shocked as to how small the size were. Let alone I wasn't even close to being full. Yeah maybe I'll opt for the salad next time vs spending $3+ for something I finished within 10 seconds!"

It's quick, yummy and the cashiers are nice! I've always been greeted with a smile and people who actually ENUNCIATED their words!!! O.M.G.

Personally, I prefer my fried chicken spicy, a la Popeye's. The service at Chick-fil-A is nothing short of remarkable. When they first opened the restaurant on Chicago, the line was out the door and down the block. Believe it or not, I think I waited in line less than ten minutes before I ordered and god my food. And you will not wait more than about two minutes for your food, if that.What I don't like about Chick-fil-A is the political leanings of the parent corporation. I won't go into it here, this is not the place. Do your own research if you're interested. But the politics kills Chick-fil-A for me. I'll eat more chicken, but I'll do it somewhere else."

Regular Chick-fil-A sandwich was lightly breaded and perfectly moist inside. Great seasoning. Dee-lic-ious. And as far as fast food chicken sandwiches go, this one is kind of healthy for you because it's pressure cooked in peanut oil, which is trans fat and cholesterol free. Also tried the grilled chicken sandwich--tasty and fewer calories. The golden wheat bun and the pickles are a nice touch. Can't go wrong with the waffle fries. Surprisingly large seating area in this place. Service is fast and efficient so even if there's a line, it goes by quick."

These places have been springing up like hot cakes and I heard there were even people camping out at one that opened recently near my house to get in for opening day. So I stopped by one recently with my family to see what this place was all about. First impression.....reminded me of a clean McDonald's ....without the greasy smell. Ordered the spicy chicken sandwich, it was good, and definitely tasted,  looked like I was not eating something that resembled chicken but was actually chicken. However,  I still felt like I was eating at a fast food place, and in the end, still had that fast food regret feeling when I left. So bottom line.....I don't think it's healthier, but this chicken probably clucked at one point as opposed to the so called chicken you get at other places that serve in a similar manner."

I don't go nearly as often as I'd like, since I'd prefer to stay in my current clothing size, but the food is really, really good. The chicken sandwiches/strips/nuggets outshine any that I've tasted at comparable fast food joints. The staff is oddly perky, which I appreciate. The restaurant is clean and feels less like a McDonalds, and more like a Panera. This location is extremely busy though, so be prepared to get death stares from patrons if you plan to ""hang out"" after you're done eating. There just isn't room."

What really changed it for me was ordering the chick-fil-a sandwhich on a golden wheat bun with some honey mustard on it...My life has never been the same. It was probably one of the happiest moments of my life when I found out that there was a chick-fil-a opening in downtown Chicago. If I could, I would live above it so that I could eat there 6 days a week... as a bonus, its probably one of the nicest chick-fil-a i've ever been to. Go here.

It's been over a month and my mouth still waters when I think about it. The restaurant was busy, the line was long, but moved very quickly. All of the staff I encountered were great and so nice.

When this location was planned, I drove by weekly, checked online for daily status updates, and I was upset when I missed the grand opening because I was at home in Florida. Everything is good here! I personally love the chicken strips (3 or 4 pieces) with waffle fries and YOU MUST get Chick-fil-A sauce. I also like the original chicken sandwich. I cannot tell you how many people I have brought here to try it for the first time. That staff is so nice, the space is so clean, and the food is terrific. Even though the line is sort of long at times, it goes super fast and you always receive service with a smile. I have had breakfast here as well, the chicken biscuits are amazing. As a testament to the service here, I had to wait for five minutes for my order once and I received a coupon for a free sandwich on my next visit. You can also check in on foursquare and receive a free large waffle fry on your fourth check in. The inside also has original Chicago decor including a bench that was an original part of the stands in the old Soldier Field. All of the pictures are also Chicago-centric. They also have a lot of events for the community, yes I've taken a picture with the cow, and kids nights. The owners also regularly walk around and check how everyone is doing. Their milkshakes are also AWESOME! I go here once a week and I'm not afraid to admit it."

The chicken itself had a nice kick and was very filling.  The place seemed pretty big, wasn't too busy when I was there, but it was also close to 8:00 AM.

When I tired of my free #1 meals (OK, that is rare) I actually do pay for others, and I'm happy to do so.  Yes, I'm from the South, and it warms my heart to find this little pocket of efficiency and friendliness here in downtown Chicago. I'm proud to say I've converted many a dubious Chicago native to CFA fandom.Perhaps no other brand inspires such a rapid following in Southerners as Chick-Fil-A, and for good measure. Simple, delicious, craving-inspiring food served with a heaping side of politeness. Get takeout, and they take your name and personally bring it to you lickety-split. Eat in, and more often than not, someone will offer to clear the trash from your table before you've realized you even have trash. Now, where else do you see this at fast-food prices? One time I was in there with coworkers for lunch, and an employee asked if we'd like a free jug of sweet tea. Hell yes, please. Not 10 minutes had passed when we were offered yet another free jug of sweet tea. Why, hell yes, we'll have more, thank you.

Being a frequent customer, I have had the opportunity to get comped meals - if you ever have an issue, you can kindly let someone know because they want to be aware and fix the problem. And, that usually includes some kind of apology to you and free chicken in the future. Who doesn't love free chicken and knowing that management cares about feedback?I usually stick to the class Chick-fil-A sandwich, which translates to the amazing chicken biscuit in the morning.

Technically, the gift card was supposed to be for Target, but I used it to get a meal at the restaurant on Chicago Avenue downtown. I got a meal of chicken nuggets and fries with a large lemonade. The lemonade was way too tart and had too much ice in it so it was watered down, but didnt help tone the tart taste. The fries and nuggets were not that good I've had better food at Food Life at Water Tower than Chik-fil-A. I didnt care much for the food if they had something more interesting than the nuggets I would be inclined to try it. Unfortunately this place seems to be popular with the clueless college students who burn up their money on fast food garbage than anything that's deemed nutritious..

It was sort of like watching the Sonic commercials while living in New York, and the closest Sonic being in the neighboring state, New Jersey. But while in Chicago, I finally encountered a Chick-fil-A and knew I had to try it. Although it was only for breakfast, it didn't matter, I was going to get my Spicy Chicken fix.I was surprised when I walked into this establishment. It was clean, vibrant, and just felt like a step-up from the drab Burger Kings, Wendy's and McDonald's. The LCD screens serving as the menu really put it over the top, making it feel more like a gourmet fast-food joint. Especially after I put my order in, one of the staff personally came up to me to hand my meal in a brown bag. Wow, that's service!I ordered the Breakfast Burrito with Spicy Chicken ($2.69), consisting of red and green peppers, scrambled eggs, breaded pieces of spicy chicken breast, onions, and a blend of Monterey Jack and Cheddar Cheese all wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it tasted, as if prepared at a diner with fresh ingredients. It didn't taste like one of those frozen burritos you stick in the microwave or McDonald's unappealing breakfast burrito McSkillet wraps. And the separate package of Spicy Salsa really took it over the top adding a refreshing perspective to an otherwise solid burrito with some subtle heat. And I have to say that Chick-fil-A's breakfast burrito was quite hearty in all its glory of 450 calories and 24 grams of protein! 24 grams! I found myself full until lunch time.I usually refrain from eating fast-food, but I'm actually now a believer of Chik-fil-A and wish they had some in the metropolitan New York area. Sadly, they do not yet. But if you're lucky to pass one of these and are in the mood for fast-food, I highly recommend checking out Chick-fil-A."

After hearing rave reviews about it on WMBI 90.1 in Chicago, I was excited to try it. Unfortunately I was on my health kick at the time--no fried foods, so I ordered a Grilled Chicken Sandwich. It was okay, but I wasn't impressed--no offense to CfA it's just I have never had a grilled sandwich I really liked, let's face it, Chicken is meant to be fried.  Refusing to leave unfulfilled--who knows when I'd ever get to try CfA again, I ordered the Original Chicken sandwich, took a taste of it and immediately realized I had ordered wrong. It was too late to enjoy it since I was already full with the Grilled, but that one bite was enough to understand what the rave was. Yesterday feeling totally embarrassed after making an uncharacteristic foolish-urban-cyclist move that makes all us urban cyclists look bad , I decided to stop at Chick-fil-A. I continued my normal workout route and on the way back I made a ""via point"" turn, if I may borrow the term from my GPS, to Chick-fil-A on Chicago Avenue. The line was long, but it moved pretty fast.  I ordered #1 on the menu board.  They offered some sauces to go with. I asked for the Buttermilk Ranch and later noticed they also had their own namesake sauce which I should have tried instead. Then I overheard the couple next to me loading up on the Polynesian Sauce so I asked to exchange the Ranch but the nice clerk let me keep both. I loaded my dinner into my backpack til I found a spot along Oak Street beach. I pulled out the sandwich and found it packed in a cute little foil bag that retained a good amount of heat from the 30 minutes it took me to start eating the sandwich at Oak Street Beach.  Delay due to the fact I had to stop to admire the incredible mural on the east wall of the underpass. The sandwich had a rather large piece of chicken in it. One bite and all my bad feelings from my earlier bike mistake disappeared.  It seemed to tie the whole beautiful evening with the perfect unseasonable weather together like a big shiny bow. Even if did take a little bit of a bath in the Polynesian sauce as I was digging for my water bottle in my back pack. Sauce was good--kind of like a mild sweet and sour sauce without the sour, but the sandwich had enough flavor to stand on its own. The Original Chicken Sandwich is the way to go!  One bite and in that instant you'll know."

I had only visited a Chick-fil-A once at a mall and thought their chicken sandwich was really no big deal and super hyped up.  But my second experience changed my mind.This time I ordered an 8 piece chicken meal (which included a drink and waffle fries).  The 8 pieces of chicken were super small. Much smaller than the size of McDonald's McNuggets.  But the chicken tasted great, was filling, and looked like real chicken meat (unlike McD's).  Their waffle fries tasted great with the ranch sauce too.  While eating, I had a change to peruse their entire menu, which had a lot of healthy options.  As I was leaving, the line to Chick-fil-A was almost out the door! (This was around 4pm)There is a lot of seating and the set up is very open.  They have many different size tables which even includes a communal table with stool seats.  The restrooms were clean and their door offers a no-hands touch handle! You'll have to see it to understand what I mean.  Service here was  really great!Make sure to grab some napkins before leaving if you take your food to go. They don't include it in your bag."

Num, num, num, num.Holy Hell, this tastes good!Now I thought the spicy chicken sandwich was a minimalist Creation--just chicken, bun, a couple of pickle slices....  THIS sandwich has lettuce, tomato, jack cheese...HEY!  Wait a minute!!!  This is a DELUXE spicy chicken sandwich.  I've been upgraded!CHOMP!

Num, num, num, num.Oh my Gosh!  I've taken the wrong order!!  (But it's an upgrade, not a downgrade, so I really can't complain.)  And now, someone who actually paid for this sandwich is giving Hell to the counter people for losing their order.CHOMP!

Num, num, num, num.""Tom...Tom...TOM!!!""  I hear my name shouted across the room, over and over, louder and LOUDER.  They're calling me on purpose, to get me to confess my sin. CHOMP! Num, num, num, num.It's not my fault!  It's your stupid ordering system!  There wasn't a name or order number on my bag!   I asked the woman who handed me this white anonymous paper bag if it was for me, and she didn't say anything!  IT""S NOT MY FAULT!!!I'm going straight down into a lake of fire for this.*Burp*"

I've had their chicken sandwich and the chicken tenders before. The tenders were good, but the sandwich didn't blow me away. I thought it was very plain. So when I was looking to get a quick dinner before class, I ordered the spicy chicken deluxe sandwich to go. They put the sandwich into a little black takeout container. When I opened up the container approximately 15 minutes later, the sandwich was still very much in tact. The sandwich wasn't smashed and flattened like they are when you order McDonalds' McChicken sandwich. Wow, I was impressed. Then when I bit into my sandwich, wow, it's actually spicy! No offense to Americans, but I usually find that most American restaurants don't understand spice. I was prepared to add some hot sauce to my sandwich, but I didn't need to. Pepperjack cheese was a good choice for this sandwich (though I have to admit that I'm really not fond of American cheese at all).

And I jump up and down with glee to get my fave chicken.  And now, we have our very own location.  It's a warm, fuzzy feeling.I have to admit, I was SUPER impressed that the line was out the door both times I've been in since they opened and my total wait was under 5 minutes.  That's incredible.  They were prepared for the rush and acted accordingly.  Thank you for thinking ahead and for the friendly, helpful staff.  The key to Chick-fil-A?  It's fast food without the greasy, cheap fast food feel.I am a fan of the nuggets and the original chicken sammich.  I'm crushing on those cute lil pickles.  Yummy!The only reason they get 4 stars:  I really hate that the chain isn't open on Sundays.  Boooooo!And... I really wish they had a drive thru over there.  Oh well.  Not a deal breaker."

One thing I did notice about the employees is that they are super-fast: at taking your order, taking your money, giving you change, giving you food, it's all fast!

Meh.  However, if one word isn't enough for you, then read on...The entire ordering system in there is an organized chaos... once you find the line, an employee will direct you to the next available cashier (each cashier raises their hand when ready for the next customer), the cashier will ask you for your name then ask for your order.  Once your order has been placed, you step back and wait for another employee to come out from behind the counter with your order whilst hollering your name.  It was crazy busy in there, but I was in and out surprisingly fast.Now... my shake looked pretty, but turned out to be a little on the watery side.  I like THICK shakes.  The fries were decent, but could use some kind of seasoning in my opinion.  They actually messed up my sandwich order.  I asked for no cheese and no pickle, but the cashier put extra pickle.  I guess I could've noticed had I been paying attention to the screen, but I was just trying to get out of there and away from the crowd.  So the chicken breast itself was decent, but again lacked in flavor.  I had to remove the pickles myself.  The bun is too small and squishy.  I think it was a combination of the flimsy bun, the heat of the chicken, the soupy tomatoes, and pickle juice... but my sandwich was falling apart as I ate it.Oh!  A co-worker of mine ordered a chicken caesar wrap (when I ordered it, the cashier asked me what kind of dressing I wanted... duh!).  It's a pre-made wrap, with the dressing on the side.  Defeats the purpose... don't you think?Overall, I didn't think Chick-Fil-A was anything to write home about.  I was hoping for some flavor.  Nothing spectacular."

It was packed, but the lines moved fairly quickly. I waited no more than a few seconds for my name to be called.Headed outside to sit in the outdoor area to eat and people watch. I gobbled up my grilled chicken sandwich and it was ok. I would have to try it next time without the cheese and bacon. The chicken is flavorful by itself, so there really is no need to dress it up or drown it in ketchup. My fries were a bit soft, but tasted really good, so next time I'll ask for crispy fries.I also ordered 6 pieces of nuggets for later in the day, and I have to say I couldn't stop laughing when I opened up the container. The nuggets are super tiny, but very tasty, and served well as a snack. If your hungry, go for a bigger amount of nuggets. (The Polynesian Sauce is really fantastic!)I washed it all down with a nice cup of ice cold sweet lemonade. Overall, their flavorful tender chicken is the draw to this place, and I'm impressed---smiling employees is always a plus. For a fast food joint specializing in an affordable chicken menu, I'll come back again...not too soon as their menu offerings are not the healthiest, but it is a great place to cheat on any diet."

Before that, it was probably 10 years.  The taste of bread, chicken and pickle is so distinct in my memory, that when I eat it now, I can feel my childhood mall around me.There is a halcyon taste to their chicken nuggets. There's little chunks of kingfisher sprinkled into every deep fryer basket full.I went 3 times in the first week and I'm only slightly embarrassed.ok, so this place can get really crowded, but they're reasonably quick. i kinda wish there was a smoother pickup system. you can get a sammy for $3-$4.politics. sigh. let's just say that the opening day of chick fil a had me VERY conflicted.

I don't know about the guy who couldn't find the ketchup packets - probably because these are a different shape and size than normal.To those complaining about the prices.  A deluxe sandwich, fries, and soft drink for less than $7 before taxes - I don't really know where you can do better.Noise level of the place when busy: conversation-challenging.They seem to have a good selection of non-sandwich options, and I'll try one of those next time."

I then started to see this particular chain show up in airports. Each experience I had was quite subpar. This past Wednesday I had a few drinks at Vertigo and was in need of some food. I thought about going to McDonalds on Chicago Ave to grab a Big Mac until I remembered this joint just opened a few weeks ago. A few people were telling me the food is the beezneez, but again I thought back to my prior experiences. I walked in and the line wasnt bad. I ordered the Spicy Chicken Sandwich combo.

The interior is very nice and clean, and the wait staff is ridiculously polite/attentive. I think they are trying to create a good impression, so it remains to be seen how long this will last. Upon entering, there was a greeter that was handing out menus (!!) to people in line. You know, just in case the giant flat screen menus on the wall weren't enough. The place was very crowded as well, which is understandable given the hype surrounding Chick-fil-A (downside: it can be tough to find a seat, which is almost unheard of for a fast food place). Ordering was painless and the food arrived quickly. There was also a manager-type guy who walked around to literally every table and asked how we were doing and if we needed any refills. It was a nice gesture, but started to get kind of creepy after awhile. I'm here for fast food, not for fine dining!The food was very good, but pricey for fast food. Chick-fil-A has a reputation for being a very good fast food place, and now I understand why. Definitely worth checking out."

First thing I noticed was that there were at least ten cash registers open and ready to take our order.  Since it was still breakfast time, I got the original chicken sandwich on biscuit along with the sausage, egg, and cheese on ciabatta.  My biscuit was a bit dry but the chicken itself was tasty.  Much more flavor and taste than KFC.  In terms of the ciabatta sandwich, I didn't like how the ciabatta worked as a breakfast sandwich.  Perhaps it could be a texture thing but I wasn't feeling it.  I now know that muffins, bagels, and biscuits are now the way to go.The manager there came around to check on us and see if we were enjoying our food.  He even offered some directions in case we needed to get to the game.  I'm not sure he does this for all of his customers but we obviously were tourists from the Giants gear we were wearing.  But points to him nonetheless as I've never gotten greeted by a manager at any fast food establishment at anytime in the past.If there ever was a Chick-fil-A to open in the SF Bay Area, then I'd hope that they make it similar to his location in terms of its size and the food it produces."

Grilled Chicken Sandwich was just alright. Unfortunately, it wasn't as tasty as their original, but then again, how can you beat deep fried chicken?I liked how they used some sort of whole wheat looking bun for the grilled chicken sandwich. I wonder if we can make any bun substitutions for the other sandwiches.I'm not sure why the Grilled Chicken sandwich was in a styrofoam box, where as the other 2 crispy sandwiches were in a foil lined bag.Strawberry milkshake was pretty decent. It wasn't too sweet and didn't taste fake. Also had real strawberry bits in them. I don't normally drink milkshakes, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. Downside of carrying out was that the the buns get a little soggy from being packaged up too long...They have the condiment bar to the side so you can pick out the sauces of your choice to your content. But be aware that majority of their sauces have high-fructose corn syrups and preservatives in them. I'll probably come back again, but will plan on eating it there to avoid the soggy buns."

The biggest disappointment were the fries.  I love a good waffle fry but these were way under cooked and not very hot.  Maybe because they just opened and they were very crowded that they were trying to get the food out a little too fast.  Should I go back again, I would definitely tell them to make my fries well done."

I had their char-broiled chicken sandwich w/ lettuce, tomato, pickle and honey bbq sauce and it was very tasty. Especially for a fast food chain like Chick-fil-A, I wouldn't mind going back. But I did let them know that their honey bbq sauce, ketchup and bbq sauce all had HFCS and would love to see them eliminate that from their sauces.

Pretty much everything is good, you can't really go wrong with fried chicken, but I think the Spicy Chicken Deluxe is the best.  I also love that they have a very organized sauce station where you can choose what sauces and how many you like.The cookies and cream milkshake or the chocolate chip cookies are a sweet way to finish your meal.  I think Chick-fil-a and I are off to a beautiful and fattening friendship!"

Every other Chick-fil-A I have been to, the service is what gets me. At this location I felt like a cow in a stockyard. The guy at the register didn't make eye contact; after he swiped my card he failed to even speak to me again. No ""thank you,"" didn't tell me where to wait for my food, just called out ""next guest!"" in my ear and allowed the next person to push me out of the already crowded register area. Say thanks at least and tell me where the dipping sauces are hidden behind some random pillar in the dining room. And the staff ""working"" the dining room could take some tips from their smaller sister stores. Talk to people and don't have a look on your face like you're slave labor in a sixteenth century Turkish prison. I'll be back for the food because I'm an addict, but the customer service here is horrendous."

I still can't believe the cult following behind chick-fil-a. I have now officially tried it twice in my life and can say that it is definately better than a lot of other fast food options. We were in line for dinner during the grand opening and was suprised by the efficiency of the staff. I was expecting to be in line for 30 minutes, but I walked right up and ordered with the friendly staff. My food came in less than 1 minute which is a plus/minus. The spicy chicken burger deluxe had a healthy size piece of chicken with fresh garnish and cheese. The only downside to the speed that day was the temperature of the chicken. The chicken was lukewarm and likely had been waiting to be served for a short bit of time, but the chicken had just the right amount of spicy. Another positive, is the waffle fries which always hit the spot! Great job on opening day.Pro- quick service, fresh/good quality food, good flavors, friendly staffCon- the chicken patty was lukewarm..., hopefully it will be better once the massive crowds die downHidden deal- management was passing out coupons for free breakfast items"

Waffle fries, the best classic chicken sandwich you can find in the fast food business, and awesome dipping sauces (Polynesian, honey mustard, BBQ, etc). Fast food so good that people will put up with it being closed on Sundays and a homosexual ex-roomie would nosh on it regardless of whatever their evangelical founder has to say. Now I no longer I have to suffer heartburn from wolfing down this rare delicacy so fast on my visits home to GA."

After half an hour I'm at my house and give the nuggets to my wife. We eat it after I change my clothes. My wife loves chicken because of its crispiness. She also likes the flavor of it. She said that it seasoned well. For me the only good thing is the skin because it's currency. I don't like the chicken since it's hard and too dry but its flavor was good.

I waited.. 10 minutes passed I asked another employee I believe his name was Jamie and I asked him can he check on the status of this order he said if it isn't out yet they are still working on it.. another 10 mins passed still nothing 10 minutes turned into 20 mins that turned into 35 mins and I asked Jamie once again and he said if it's a big order then they might still be working on it. The order was for (4) 30ct nuggets and (8) large French fries. Not one time did Jamie look on the screen or anything to confirm that the order was in queue so I asked Jamie if I can speak to a manager his words were ""they ain't here"" so I asked someone else if anyone can hear me ""Is there a manger here?"" A Latino woman walked up and said yes may I help you I explained to her I have been waiting here for 35 mins for this order I show her the details on my phone she looks up the order on the register and says oh I see it here let me process the order and push it through the queue meaning it hasn't even been started yet. So you can see my frustration here at this point. I then tell the manager that her employee I point over to him told me that there was no manager on site and she then says oh I'm sorry about that I'll speak to him later about that. I walk over to sit down and I then say to Jamie ""oh I thought your manager wasn't here which turns into an argument. I go outside and here comes Jamie bringing 2 bags one in a paper bag so full that when he hands the food to me the bag falls to the ground and rips and another bag. I go back inside to ask for another bag because the one he pushed into my hands falls and rips. And I get the bag and leave. I was so angry that i didn't even realize what he just handed to me so I go back into my hot bag while I'm already driving towards the customer and realize he gave me a bag full of chicken nuggets in boxes and Big bottle of ranch and a salad. On my way to the customer I explain to them what happened and I am sorry that this happened but the service here is horrible. I do not recommend this place. The delivery was dropped off at 12:41 pm. It shouldn't take 1 hour to make this order and then at that get the wrong items. As a delivery driver as a customer you don't want to be treated poorly or even ignored especially if I'm picking up an order for someone who has paid over 100$ for something a restaurant with such employees can't get right or even try to. I added the picture of the employee who was disrespectful and rude."

It's one of the more tempting breakfast and lunch options there is, and a whole lot of people want to eat the most delicious made to order above average fast food around. Just don't go if you're in a hurry. Maybe pretend you're in New York where having to endure an agonizing wait for seemingly basic food items like chicken tenders is considered a mark of quality. The employees appear to be working and not screwing around, which isn't the case with many fast/fast casual dining establishments.

However my first visit was pretty disappointing. I went before working a night shift (I'm a nurse) and ordered drive thru. They gave me the wrong sandwich so I went to the door to tell them. The girl I spoke to went back in to get me a new sandwich- which was still not the one I had ordered and paid for. I told her and she said I was wrong and it was ""impossible"" and asked to see the sandwiches.. saying that in front of other customers there made me feel like she thought I was lying. She went back in and 10 mins later she brought someone out with her who I explained the situation to- she asked for my receipt which they did not give me when I paid and then went back inside. I told them I was a nurse and really needed to leave to get to the hospital on time for my shift. They finally came out with what I had originally ordered. All in all it took about 25 mins and I was then running late to work- I ate fast as I drove and ended up with a stomach ache for the next few hours, not exactly how I wanted to start my work day.

It was delicious the food was prepared well and fresh. Even though this Chick Fil A is for Most UHD student it was a great place to eat. The service was proficient and I would definitely come back there again.

You'd think that would be a good combination but instead I am Charlie Brown and this location is Lucy. Tempting me to come back only to leave me absolutely enraged for like the 50th time. First the chance of getting your order correct is batting about .485. And if you don't cover every conceivable detail of the order like your prepping the space shuttle for launch can 100% percent count in the order being wrong. In our two years of misery we've experienced:- ordering a large amount of nuggets at the drive through. Paying. Going through the line. Sitting in the parking lot for 15 mins until someone came out to tell us that they can't sell us that many nuggets a through the drive. My favorite and most frequent is when I order a ""meal"" of nuggets for my son and then also order Mac and cheese only to get my bag and discover that they have substituted Mac &cheese for the fries. If I specifically order the meal and then I say I'd like to also order X it means both. That should be standard English. I shouldn't have to double and triple check every item in the bag. I don't know why I'm typing this because I'm a fool for ever returning to this location. Maybe my on public shaming will finally guide myself and others elsewhere."

I was so disappointed in the staff, food and management. I was greeting by an associate on foot, but I had to yell to place my order. She finally walked to my vehicle to get my order. Of course, when I finally received my order it was someone else's. I return the food and they did not throw it away although it had already been touched by me during a pandemic. I finally got what I ordered and the fries were cold and the chicken had fatty pieces. My drink also wasted in my vehicle because the lid was not on properly. I rated them 1 star because o spoke with management because I preferred a full refund but Sloane Pardue refused for whatever reason and simple gave me a reward for more chicken. I will not be visiting this establishment again thanks to that encounter. I see why the ratings before me were poor but reasonably so."

The Breakfast Before Books Program encourages everyone to start their day off right with breakfast! The only thing is that the offer is redeemable only before 10:30am. Also, Chick-fil-A is closed on Sundays.Another obstacle was finding a nearby location. I drove to three Chick-fil-A restaurants in the downtown area and all three were nonexistent.Hmmm...I was determined to get a free breakfast, so, thank goodness that this location on Shearn Street  was open.After parking easily, I walked up to the counter (because the drive-thru had a long line). I showed my QR code to the cashier and got my free Chicken Biscuit - no problem!Wow!This makes me want to return tomorrow! The REAL chicken was moist, tender, and seasoned well. The biscuit was soft and didn't fall apart. Yum! Too bad that the free offer is only redeemable once a week.Next week, the free food offer will be Spicy Chicken Biscuit... shucks! I'll pass on the spicy!"
4,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,5 star rating,7/28/2021,This location is good. Food is always hot and only twice out of all the times I've gone here has my order been missing something (which was easily corrected by just going inside). This place gets EXTREMELY busy but the line goes by impressively quickly despite that.
5,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,2 star rating,7/20/2021,Friendly staff but wow the drive thru was so slow. Got stuck in the line for so long with a screaming baby for just a drink and fruit cup. :(
6,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,2 star rating,7/15/2021,"I feel bad for the employees at work here because I'm sure they have heard a lot of complaints today! I love Chick-fil-A and I would not write a review if I hadn't had a bad experience here twice.  Several months ago I had some time before work so I figured I would grab breakfast at the drive thru and the system was so slow that I ended up being late to work because I got in the line and couldn't get out when I realized it was going to take forever.  Today, I have the day off work so I decided to try again. Today was even worse! Their payment system went down I guess so they had to take everybody's order and payment all over again. I was there for at least 20 if not 25 minutes. I imagine they made a lot of people late to work today and I saw several people pulling out of the line without anything to show for their wait. My food as always was delicious but I will not come back to this location because it seems like just can't get the drive-through situation correct."

8,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,1 star rating,7/9/2021,I came for the breakfast. Got in line at 10:15 but the line was so long that I ordered at 10:32 and they said I couldn't get breakfast. Not pleased
9,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,4 star rating,7/5/2021,"I had a great experience with this Chick-fil-a. I used door dash to have it delivered and the whole order was correct and fresh tasting. I even asked for extra pickles on each sandwich and they made sure to do that. I mean, has there ever been an awful Chick-fil-a?? Even typing this review is making me want to go and get some."
10,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,5 star rating,6/11/2021,"Call me bias, but Chick-Fil-A has NEVER disappointed, especially this location. All of the employees make you feel welcomed and are truly so kind and helpful.  I seriously need to know the mastermind behind their employee training because a lot of these major retailers and companies need to take notes!  They always have a traffic control officer or person to assist with customers in the drive-thru and those entering the parking lot. I usually ordered their grilled nuggets and large fry w/ Chick-Fil-A sauce.  I have yet to receive a bad order or the wrong items. Keep doing what you're doing Chick-Fil-A......keep doing what you're doing."
11,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,1 star rating,5/10/2021,"I wasn't expecting to see such low reviews for a Chick-fil-A, but it makes sense. The location does not hold up to the usual standards in customer service that you receive from other locations. It's a very busy one & they do move with urgency however, they have flaws in how guest should be treated when visiting. Especially if I've spent 10mins in line to support the business.For starters, the traffic cop (a woman) is rude as hell. I'm not sure if it's the heat outside or what but she is unnecessarily aggressive. She stands in the middle of the drive thru yellinging at people & that's not how I'd like to be greeted when first arriving anywhere. Secondly, I ordered my chicken sandwich (no pickles) then received a free one because it was my first mobile order (with pickles). I personally can not eat pickles. So I asked the manager if I could swap it for a sandwich without pickles. Since it's the same price. The manager wasn't tryna hear it, which is odd cause it's just pickles & I'm at Chick-fil-A. I kinda hold y'all to a different standard than i would a KFC per say, usually y'all very happy to ensure their customers are pleased with everything. I ended up giving them the sandwich back, saying ""thank you"" then leaving. I'm disappointed in this location & I'd rather go to the one on Kirby that's currently under construction & only offering waffle fry chips with meals. At least they are nicer."

13,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,1 star rating,3/2/2021,"I have never written a negative Yelp review, but I truly felt inspired after tonight's experience. I have had too many negative experiences at this chick-fil-a to count. The amount of employees with sour, negative attitudes outweigh the few pleasant ones, which is unlike any other chick-fil-a I've been to. I'm not sure who's operating that inefficient and disorganized drive through. I honestly wouldn't mind the wait and confusion if it wasn't for the frequent and unnecessary eye rolls, snarkiness, and incessant whistle blowing from the employees. I accounted my numerous previous experiences to the employees just having bad days, but after my approximately 10th negative experience tonight, it's obviously the standard here. Has anyone else had the same experience with this location? I'm honestly confused."
14,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,1 star rating,2/25/2021,"Let's start by saying who doesn't like this place?I'm not a huge fan of it, but I do eat it once a month, or less. You have to when you run out if options, I am in a virtual annual sales meeting at Home , watching and interacting from the comfort of home, the last thing I want to do is drive, so I order in for two , up sized it for more fries and drink , asked for specific sauce because every have different preferences, but to make it shorter , I get the food in a good time, but as I open my sealed bag I see the fries are half empty, and there was no sauce of any kind, and I don't keep anything like that at my place , just ketchup, my next option was to drive to a close location, but I couldn't because of my limited time, also that would defeat the purpose of paying a delivery fee. So in the end it was a bad lunch , it was like eating milk and cookies , without the milk if you get what I'm saying. Someone should look at their location and get it together, delivery and pick up to go is the new way, please get the orders properly packed. Disappointing!!! We expected more out of Chik Fil A."
15,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,1 star rating,2/23/2021,"Very poor service at this location, especially when when ordering via curbside pickup. If you order ahead of time, expect to wait 30 minutes for curbside pickup and for your meal to be cold. Very disrespectful workers who have hit my vehicle and been abrasive when I needed help/there was something wrong with my order."
16,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,5 star rating,1/4/2021,"Literally the best Chik-fil-A that I've patronized. The associates are extremely friendly and my order has always been correct. Plus, the line moves really fast."

They were very respectful and made an effort to accommodate me and try to take my order however said that breakfast had already been stopped. Terrible experience with the chick fil a app I suppose, nonetheless, thanks for the kindness and effort of the store."

AND you all desperately  need to come up with better protocol when it comes to closing time while still having people in line. We waited for over 15 minutes in line for y'all to take the cars order in front of us and completely and purposely ignore us the second it turned 10. I was taken back by the employees demeanor when she realized it was closing time. We tried to ask her but she walked away and turned off the lights as we were talking to her?? Then we were stuck in the line because there were people behind us and no one knew what to do! It was so unprofessional. As someone who's worked in the food industry, I implore you to come up with a better system or atleast train your employees to treat people like they actually exist after closing. Unfortunately for now I'll have to consider this location the most unprofessional chic I've been to so far :/ I hope you all take your reviews into consideration because I don't seem to be the only one with issues here!"
19,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,1 star rating,11/25/2020,"Never have I ever had such a poor Chick-fil-A experience than at this location. They must be paid by the mistake because it's always one thing or another. This location seems to habitually charge customers for items they did not order, not provide a receipt, then discourages reversing and reprocessing the order correctly, and instead encourages you to call customer service. If you're craving some fried chicken then consider Frenchys, Louisiana Fried Chicken, Breakfast Klub, or Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken. The food tastes better and is better quality than Chick-fil-A's and the service can't possibly be any worse than the sh*tshow these clusterf*cks muster."
20,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,1 star rating,9/27/2020,For real I love Chick Fil A. It's my favorite. So it hurts me to leave this review. But this specific location never not Fs up! Always the wrong drink. Always the wrong side. Always missing SOMETHING. This is not normal Chick Fil A behavior but this is their closest location to my house. I have to go to a different (much further) location because girl will drive for some good customer service and chicken. Get it together Chick Fil A @ 2222 Shearn. I'm a Silver Status member just points from Red Status so I believe my review to be credible.

I got a notification on the app that they just started serving the seasonal mango tea/lemonade, so I decided to drive over just to try it. I don't drink tea for religious purposes, so I just wanted to get mango lemonade. They did a similar drink last summer and I had no issues customizing the drink, because it's 1/2 tea, 1/2 lemonade, and a pump of syrup so it's easy to leave out the tea. The associate in the drive thru was very confused by my request and had to go ask someone about it. When he came back he told me that they couldn't fulfill my request. This didn't make any sense to me so I asked him why, and he couldn't give me an actual answer. He also said that leaving the tea out defeated the purpose of the drink, which was an unnecessary and rude comment. In the end, they wouldn't make the drink the way I wanted and it was a waste of time because I only went there to try the new drink. Poor customer service if you ask me."

Then I wait for a refund, then WAIT to RE-PURCHASE what they messed up on and then they ask me to pull forward and wait. At that point it would have been best to just give  me that item free and not of charging me again for a cheaper menu item.

I also paid extra for lettuce & tomatoes, which were very wet, which made the sandwich even more soggy.  Also, the bag that the food was placed in was too small and wouldn't even close.  Open bag = cold fries on top of them being soggy.  Cookie was hard and not fresh.  What happened to the quality?"

Typically at restaurants when they get the order wrong they give you what you wanted complimentary. I specifically asked for spicy deluxe and got spicy because the lady messed up the order. Then the manager came and told me if I wanted the deluxe I would have to go back and pay the additional dollar or so for the upgrade.

She offers me cookies, I decline. She goes to the back to see what's going on, comes back and offers me a ""gallon of anything."" I decline. I continue to wait and the gentleman comes back and says ""you had the nugget tray right?""

I get it, you're busy however, a 40 minute wait time from 6:30pm(when my order was scheduled for pick up) is 100% ridiculous. I don't want free cookies, I don't want a free gallon off anything. If this wasn't a tray for guest, I 100% would've asked for a refund and left without the strips. I would've appreciated Atleast a heads up. This ticket wait time is ridiculous.

61,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,5 star rating,11/4/2018,They contacted me immediately about my review. They requested that my friend get in touch with them as they were very concerned. They have floor hostess on site to deal with any issue or concern by customers. My friend is shy and one not to address it. Even her grown children encouraged her to tell them! I'm not sure if she reached out to them as they requested. She is not computer savvy.

And Chick-fil-A always prides themselves of excellent customer service. Today I went back up to order a bag of fresh chocolate chip cookies. They normally melt in your mouth. I asked the cashier if the cookies were made fresh from today. She said we make them fresh daily. Ok great. I buy a bag, go sit dow and take a bite out of the cookie. It was hard and tasted old. I looked at the bottom of the bag, it has a sticker of when they were cooked. It's said 10/23, well today is 10/24. Everyone up front looked at me in surprise, like they had no idea there was a sticker on the bottom of the bag and that they were not made fresh daily. This Chick-fil-A definitely needs to train their front team. And you never argue with the customer especially that they are made fresh the day of, if the sticker says different. I was a little disappointed with this customer service here at this location.."

Never had an issue with my order being wrong. In fact, I don't even bother to look in my bag when I leave the drive-thru because it's always correct. The manager here is doing something right because the employees are helpful and happy to be there and service is fast. That's not an easy task considering how busy they get during the lunch rush."

It amazed me that the trash cans were motion sensored and that they had mouth wash in the bathrooms. This was perfect for me as I was on a road trip at this time and I hadn't brushed my teeth.

They also have the double-line drive thru, which is fast and convenient at any time of day.  Plus, they are constantly running promotions like free breakfast Wednesdays, so the email club is 100% worth joining.  Additionally, they have family-oriented events like princess night about once every couple of months."

This last time resulting in us not even getting the sandwich to our meal and them getting our shake flavor wrong. Then we asked for 8 condiments for 3 entree's and they told us we could only have 2 per meal and purchase an 8oz tub. Well they gave us the one we purchased, but none of our ""free"" ones. Once We got home and realized our sandwich was missing, I then called and spoke with manager David. All he offered me was a free #1, which I had already paid for and didn't get.

Every-time I go there they fuck up my order no matter how much I have to yell at the freakin intercom. They clearly don't know what grill chicken looks like because I always end up with fried. This happens multiples times they are so lazy, if they can't do that one job it's obvious you should go somewhere else. I highly recommend other choices listed. They have Panda Express, la Madeline, KFC, and chilis around the area choose one of those if you want the correct order. #overit #ByeFelicia"
91,/biz/chick-fil-a-houston-23?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Houston,1 star rating,3/4/2017,"Worst service at a CFA I have ever experienced. It was slow and 5:30 on a Saturday evening, the only line was in the drive thru. Ordered a couple kids meals and something for myself to dine in. Guy who took my order was friendly enough, though not to the extent I have come to expect from CFA. When my food came to the table I noticed we didn't have the French fries for both kids meals. I waited figuring it was coming and when it didn't went back to the place where I had ordered to ask about the fries. The two employees who addressed me asked if my fries were on the tray. When I said no and that's why I was asking, they insisted on going to my table to look. Which I thought was odd since I had ordered with one of them less than 4 minutes before. When they saw no fries on my table - then they wanted to see my receipt. I guess french fry theft by moms with two small children is the norm here. So I go back to my already inspected, no french fry table and find my receipt. When I walk back to the counter they snatch it from my hand and disappear into the food prep area behind the counter, reappearing 2 minutes later and literally tossing a bag at me across the counter with 2 small fries. Never an apology or even a shrug of the shoulders. I was treated like a criminal trying to thieve fries. We love CFA (hello mom life) but will not be back here. There are many better, kinder and more welcoming places to grab a quick dinner."

Sometimes I'll stop here for their breakfast chicken sandwich and I've always enjoyed it. I took away a star because when asked for a dog treat they said they don't do that at this location. I've read online that they will give your dog ice cream if he's with you in the drive-thru. Apparently not the case here.Line is always long but it's quick to go through. Quicker if you run inside.If you've never had chick fil-a I recommend trying!

The guy who took my order was so polite and I felt like he should have been working in a fancy restaurant. He then gave my order to a coworker who took my lunch to my seat for me (and all the customers) and asked if I needed anything else. Everyone was so well dressed and polite. The manager guy in the bow tie  was incredibly friendly and charismatic. He checked on the customer and made friendly conversation with regulars. The employees all had genuine smiles and were all so professional (many in dress shirts and ties). The place was spotless and there were fresh carnations on all the tables. Best chick-fail-a ever.

I was surprised to read all the reviews about rude employees here, but I have a theory on that. I think it depends on when you come, because the lunch and dinner crews are different. I noticed this when I came here the other day for lunch and had a less than stellar experience.I normally wouldn't come here for lunch since I work on the other side of town, but I had the day off. Like other locations, this one had CFA staff standing outside to take orders to speed up the lines at lunch time. The woman taking my order was so focused on being quick that she was cutting me off. I ordered two meals for me and a friend, and both times, as soon as I said a number, she would ask ""drink?"" without even allowing me to finish giving details about the meal. It came off a bit rude.

I went Saturday night and requested a fruit cup with no blue berries ... well they gave me extra blue berries.  I then promised myself I would never go back to this location again.  Well sadly last night I broke my promise to myself and returned to this location.  I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with no butter on the bread and no lettuce and tomato,  they gave me a spicy chicken sandwich with no pickles and no cheese. The problem with this location is they are in such a rush to take your order that they don't take the time to get it right.

That extra help I know raises their labor costs but it makes all the difference to me. After lunch we play in the indoor playground. It has never been too crowded and it seems clean.

Everyone is super nice and there are employees around everywhere trying to be helpful, but the counter is a huge bottleneck. Getting orders seems to run easily, but then everyone gathers in this one little place to collect. It seems like they'll bring it out to you if you sit, so perhaps telling people to sit would help, but many people are trying to get it to go. So there's a jam up there in of people just standing and waiting, and then if someone needs a sauce, they have to go back around (Hint, see 290's - they keep the sauces out. Love). Hopefully they'll figure out a more efficient way to get this part going. I ordered a nugget tray a couple weeks ago and asked for it at a certain time and still had to wait 20 minutes for it, which missed the point of ordering ahead and made me late to the event I was headed to. Still, their drive through seems to be running better than some of the others around and the lot is big enough that there is room for the cars.

Their signature catch phrase ""my pleasure"" is a testament to how dedicated their staff is to service. The food is just as impeccable as the service, my favorite being their chicken sandwich and waffle fries. The chicken sandwich has the perfect crispy texture and the meat is very tender. As for the waffle fries, they look like waffles and taste like fries. Sometimes, simplicity is bliss, and they even claim that their fruits contain only fruits. What makes their waffle fries so exceptional is the pairing of their signature sauce- Chick-fil-A sauce. It looks like honey mustard sauce but it's so difficult to describe how great it tastes. I dislike mustard to an indefinite extent, but even I enjoy their sauce. They also have great vanilla ice cream cones, perfect for a dessert snack."

The person helping me was Mercedes. I asked her to put my large coffee in my reusable cup, as I'd like to reduce the amount of waste produced on my behalf. Mercedes proceeded to get my coffee, while stating that she HAS to put in in the paper cup. Kind of defeats the purpose of trying to reduce waste. Mercedes ended up bringing my coffee in a large cup WITH a sleeve to the counter, then poured it into my reusable cup and walked over to the trash to throw the paper cup away. First of all, Mercedes was not Chick-fil-A quality when it came to her response and attitude to my request. Secondly, where is the responsibility of Chick-fil-A in trying to reduce the amount of waste that they produce? I've come to this location several times, and they are usually very friendly, fast, and put my my coffee into my reusable cup. This visit certainly did not live up to my expectations of the Chick-fil-A customer service that I'm usually accustomed to at every single other location I've ever been to."

It should not be acceptable to refuse  a customer's phone call.Initially, I tried multiple times calling because Chic Fil A's app to order food was having technical errors, but unfortunately it seemed the people weren't working either!

Then he said he wanted to discuss further in person. Then when I explained that I didn't have time to stand on the side of the curb and argue with him in person he told me he would not replace the order. However I had an experience with him six months ago that made me extremely uncomfortable because he spits when he talks and we're in a pandemic and he doesn't wear a mask. but if you mention that he will walk off without replacing your food he is extremely rude and very very cheap and will do anything to not replace your food or money"

They keep saying they don't know how to accommodate the very busy drive thru and dinning room.Well Its pretty simple after they open the dinning room they won't have as much drive thru. If they want to try to keep both going strong then re-locate, but the managers appear not to be smart enough to figure this out.With the way they are handling this I've stopped going there, everyone appears to be very confused on how to operate this place. If there hasn't been a accident yet there will be the parking lot was a nightmare the last time I went, cars parking every different direction blocking people trying to find a spot to park with the lot guy getting more confused as the time went by. I don't think they will ever open up the dinning room, the way they're doing this now they have less work to do, I think they enjoy what they are doin now making lots of money doing nothing for the customers. Lucky for everybody just about every other fast food is offering chicken stuff which some of them are pretty good and you don't have the stupid parking lot at Chick-fil-a to deal with."

We went through the drive thru yesterday for our lunch order and had the most pleasant experience. Not only did they have a great group of employees out greeting the cars/customers, the owner was out there taking orders and making sure each car was getting a great experience. They all were super efficient and took every precaution to make sure your food and any items were handled as carefully as possibly keeping to the guides of as much social distance needed. Also, the line looked like it was going to take forever to get through and yet they were fast and incredibly efficient, hardly waited long at all. We love Chick-Fil-A and we especially are appreciative of all the extra measures this location took to make sure our experience met our expectations. But have to say, it exceeded them!

I've been to other locations near here but this is by far the cleanest and best tasting location! Also, their drive thru is really well managed especially during rush hour. Came around 6 pm the other night and the drive thru line was so long that the parking lot was filled in both directions. I normally would have just left, but then I noticed the Operator himself was out standing in the parking lot helping people get into the drive thru and into the rest of the parking lot. I have never seen a person in management do this at any other food place! It was really amazing to see that instead of staying inside and letting the employees handle the intensely packed drive thru, he was right there with them! Without a doubt, this location wins the award for best customer service!"

When we attempted to leave at 12:45, I waited 23 minutes to back out.  Not a single person would stop to allow us to do so.  I was afraid my car would overheat and we were late to a dentist appointment up the street one block.  How in the world the City Planning and Zoning allowed this potential debacle is beyond me.  It's an absolute gridlock disaster.Considering people just can't be kind to one another, on top of the worst traffic  design imaginable, perhaps CFA should hire parking attendants.  Sad commentary and definitely not worth the mediocre sandwich and soggy fries."

Got in line at about 11:30 waited in line until 11:40, got to the window and was told my salads (one with no onion/tomato) we're not ready yet and they asked me to pull out front. I'm sorry but I just waited for 10 minutes in line (and time is valuable). For a salad to not be ready within 10 minutes is ridiculous let alone a half hour they had to prepare it . Needless to say this is the second time that they have messed up my order. Had I ordered steak and potatoes, I realize my order wouldn't be ready in that short of time but we're talking about a salad. They did say they would refund my money and I drove away.

A few of the low-lights:- Pre-ordered, and went to the pick up counter. Employee 'Gabby' didn't acknowledge me standing right in front of her. Finally looked up at me after about 30 seconds and just walked away. Someone else came over to ask if I needed help. Not very Chick-Fil-A like!- The meal took about 20-25 minutes. Uncharacteristically long for this business.- Fries were room temperature.-Went back up after meal to order just one additional order of fries. Figured they would just hand them to me, but was given the table marker. Was still waiting for this one order of fries 10-15 minutes later, had to go back to the counter and ask.

I'd love to overcome the objections of any person who has given them a poor rating because this location is 100% perfection. They have never given me a bad experience. Every employee is friendly and professional. The food always tastes amazing. This specific location is the reason my wife and I love Chick Fil A. I've lived near 59th Ave and Thunderbird for close to 16 years.... I actually used to be a regular at the Circle K before Chick Fil A was even a thought. To be honest, I was actually quite upset when I learned that they were tearing down the Circle K to even build a Chick Fil A. I had probably eaten CFA, 1 maybe 2 times in my life at that point so I wasn't very excited at all. Months and months went by and still no Chick Fil A. Then one day, we saw a fence around the Circle K, a few bulldozers and a giant dirt mound and we knew it was coming. It seemed like it took forever to be built, and then..... One day.... it was there lol. It looked very nice and we HAD to try it. Fast Forward about 2 years..... This is now our families GO TO place. We eat here way more often than we probably should. They always get our order right. They're always fast and friendly. The main word that I can use to describe them is ""consistent"" Last night we ate here and met the owner for the very first time. He asked if we ate here often and we told him that we ate here 2-3 times a week. It was to our surprise that we had never met him before. He was the nicest guy and it was very clear to my wife and I after talking to him for a few minutes, why this Chick Fil A is so perfect. He thanked us and gave us a bunch of free cards for sandwiches. This location deserves an award. They care about their customers, they care about their food and they care about their employees. No complaints ever in 2 years. Thumbs up guys"

99,/biz/chick-fil-a-glendale?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Phoenix,5 star rating,10/3/2017,"My favorite location. Almost always see the same friendly faces for the last year. It's always kept clean, employees actively check in on those dining to see if anything is needed. Food always ready quickly. People very competent and always seem to have managers available. The playground is the perfect size surrounded by glass walls and door so you can see your kids but don't HAVE to hear them! The only complaint I have is playground was way too full one day with kids and ones that were way to big or old to be inside, I asked a nearby employee if there was anything that could be done and I was told they don't really do anything, it's up to parents. When I mentioned older children being in there she did then enter play ground area and ask them to exit. Which is why I still give 5 stars. I have 3 kids at ages 11, 8 and 2.... my older children do going to the playground with my toddler but no to be very conscious of the little children around them and not to act like crazy people in there. If my children were to miss behave in the playground or be rude to other kids they would be removed by me immediately."

Tonight, though, we ordered food and forgot to ask for pepper jack. Our fault, but ordered the cheese and had to wait for it to come to the table. 10 minutes later still no cheese. My girlfriend went up to the counter to ask for it. Riley was very nice. She was the only one really doing anything. Had a long line and everyone else was just standing around behind her. When asked for the cheese she apologized and asked a girl with red hair and glasses. (Sorry missed her name) she immediately gave attitude. She responded with ""ok"" and then proceeded to take a tray of food to another table before just getting the single slice of cheese. Not a huge issue but the attitude will make us visit another location from now on."

Paying $10.13 for a small size meal expecting BBQ in your sandwich then realizing once you get home that you didn't get BBQ sauce is not acceptable. Tried calling the store manager but phone number states ""not accepting calls at this time"". Well looks like I'm out of luck trying to talk to someone at the restaurant and fixing the situation.

Last time I went in I had one of those free cards for a meal and wanted to use it from the last time I was there. The guy at the cash register was really nice and tried to get it to work and asked his manager 3 times for help but manger was too busy packing the food. He then looked at the card and it said I have to redeem it on 12th Avenue.  I said okay and walked out thinking okay whatever.  When I actually got to the car and looked up the address it's not even in Arizona. Like why would they give out a free meal that's not even redeemable in the state. I went and around Christmas time and it was packed. Way over 10 people in there. And most of the employees wasn't even wearing their masks properly. Like wow. Even the cook wasn't wearing a mask at all. I do have video of it too. So disappointed in Chick-fil-A. I waited for 30 mins for some fries and got the free meal card. And was happy to use it next time but it turns out I have to go to another state to use it. Waste of time!!

Not a big deal. Everything was smooth with ordering until it came to the contact with the employees. Girls taking payment ran my gift cards and then told me their iPad died and to pay at the front, then went back to talking.. at the window and the cashier had me swipe my gift cards and only one worked- because the other cashier swiped them too. So then I hear her talking to what looked like a manager and she said that I was going to have to pay for it. The cashier told me that my gift cards would work after the other transaction canceled. So I'm sure they won't work. Then they finally give me my food and I'm missing the salad- the salad that I talked to the person taking my order specifically about their salad dressing options. They look at me and tell me it's not on the order and they just look at me. At this point I'm not waiting anymore especially after all of the staff at the window could care less. I look at my receipt and the salad dressing I chose is added to one of my kids meals- but still wasn't in the bag. I rarely come to this location but I will avoid from here on out. I have never had any problem whatsoever with any chick fil a location but these people didn't care. I know it's busy- but you know you're busy every day at lunch.  Two managers just looking at me with nothing to say and no way to try and make it right.  Very poor customer service."

I always get the same thing. Either the 2 or 3 piece chicken strips with a medium or large fry (depending on if I'm  sharing with one of my kids or not) and a water with no ice. They have a bad habit of over salting the fries and only giving me one full chicken strip. They will put a quarter or half of a chicken strip in with the full one and count that as the second one which is unacceptable. I usually don't complain because let's be honest I could probably do without the extra calories but when I am sharing with my kids it is quite upsetting. Not to mention the fact that they charge per strip. The first time I complained to them about this they refused to do anything because I had thrown away the receipt even though they see me there all the time. The second time I complained about it I physically brought the food right back to them after getting it and they gave me a coupon for a cookie. I said I didnt want a damn cookie I want the chicken strips I paid for.  They have done it to me once again but since their restaurants are closed due to covid19 the only way to make a complaint is wait in the drive thru line that wraps around the building or call. I tried calling multiple times but no one answered so I decided to voice my complaint here with a picture of the ""3"" chicken strips I ordered."

They refused to accommodate me then I was told to go up front they would take care of me there & bring it to the car, only to be told I have to go through the line twice because 1 more separate order was going to make a huge impact on the line. After having to go through going through twice having me emotional by the time I got to my end destination the food was cold. I'll never go back again they didn't even fill the container full of fries half full. Very insensitive for what's going on & I work for the CDC I understand safety but having to go through the line again for 1 separate order was simply ridiculous.

So the girl helping us rudely said ""i can't let you hold it, you have to see it from here"" standing 6 feet away from our car. I'm already blind as a bat, so we told her we would wait for the ACTUAL drive thru menu because hence I had already forgot my glasses and cannot see anything. So she proceeded to give this type of body language as if she is annoyed by us not taking the order and making faces to her peers around. I'm a huge advocate to being caution due to the COVID but being rude to a customer for no apparent reason is completely unfair and unnecessary. At this point it wasn't so much about the food anymore, it was more due to her crappy customer service and if she cannot represent her work, i can't imagine what her work ethic would be."

I went through the drive thru but I have yet to see a Chick fil A dirty inside or out! The price is not too high in my opinion because the quality & size are on point & it's not heavy with grease! If you're looking for a healthier option that taste great & that's not outrageously priced you've gotta give this place a try!.."

I can't eat American cheese so I requested the same without cheese. The top part of the biscuit was very thin and the egg was thin as well. They must have removed the cheese off of a pre-prepared sandwich. All that messing with the biscuit my have been the reason the egg was cold. I was expecting better from this company. From a service point, when she handed me two bottles of orange juice I asked her to place them in a bag. Seeing I was alone in the car, it still surprised her that I wanted them in a bag."

The customer service is really good too there. Always pleasant, smiling, asking if they can bring you something when they deliver  your food. I would have given them an 5 star review, but this review is written on my experience yesterday with their curbside delivery and online ordering because that seriously needs work, at least in my opinion based on what happened yesterday. I placed the order through their mobile app. It was a large order, I will admit, as we were feeding 6 people for dinner. It was a basic order, no substitutions for this or that. When I placed the order, I thought I read a message on the site that said ""drive on over and when we see you we will start preparing your food so it will be fresh."" I thought that was a bit odd but since we live about 10 minutes away, I got into the car and drove over. I parked at the signs that said for curbside delivery only. I went in only to say I was there for curbside delivery and i was requesting a lot of their sauce. I did get a lot of sauce. I went back to my car and waited. After about 10 minutes with no food coming out, I went in to check on the status of the order. I asked someone at the counter who went over to who I presume was the manager. The manager said ""we have a curbside order?"" She went over and checked and I thought I heard her say something like ""it didn't release it."" But then a big piece of paper came out, I'm assuming our order. They did begin to process it but it was a big order. They did a great job on that and the order was accurate as ordered. So their curbside delivery/app ordering let them down. And that's the reason I gave a low rating. Perhaps an adjustment needs to be done to it. We'll be back and we'll probably try curbside delivery/app ordering again."

After multiple attempts, I decided to call the customer service number. The lady speaking to me on the phone, seemed to care and she stated that she would have the manager from this location reach back out to me. A few days passed, and I decided to call customer service again, and get an update. This time a gentleman took my info down, and stated he would get the message to the stores manager that same day. Long story short, CFA seems like a nice company, until they mess up and you want them to acknowledge the mistake on their end. So far, I have had no follow up after that last call, so I will not be going to CFA again. Yeah it's ""just food"" but my money is my money."

I decided not to go back; I don't live around the corner to drive aging. I shouldn't have this issue to beginning. On top of it all I got no ketchup but three chick-fil-a sauce which I don't like.

The lady at the window was named Jordynn, she gave us our food & she had attitude right off the back. When she failed to ask what sauces we wanted, we asked her for some and we had our bag of food in the car with us already so we thought she would just hand it to us, but no. She literally threw the sauces from the window to the bag that was inside the car. That was very rude and not okay by chick-fil-a's standards I'm sure of it.

Usually when I visit a CFA and say ""thank you"" I'm met with a ""my pleasure"", this location occasionally says ""you're welcome"", but never ""my pleasure"". It's this little things that make a difference. Additionally, I get frustrated because every other trip I make there they try to get me to order a small soda.

Negotiating the parking lot upon our arrival was easy enough as the lot was not filled to capacity as I had expected.  With entry made, we stood a the counter and reflected on the menu.  I knew a sandwich was all I could stomach.  The GF ordered some strips and the Boy ordered up a Spicy version of the legendary sandwich.The lady behind the counter seemed indifferent as we ordered.  Neither impressed this was our first time ordering or our 10th time.  The GF asked for a sampling of sauces and I am happy that she did....more on that later.We stood by and the meal was on a tray inshore order.  We made our way to table and I observed a clean and tidy restaurant.I unwrapped and bite into the illustrious chicken wedged between the bun and....was not immediately inspired by the taste. I tore open the bun to inspect it's geography and was not impressed even though I observed to pickle slices I had missed in the first bite.  After adding a contains of a container of Chick-fil-A sauce did I begin to enjoy my sandwich.The GF fingers were a great combination of crunchy and moistness.

I got home and when I remove my sandwich from the bag and it is so the chicken burnt that it is literally crumbling into pieces out of the bun. I had ordered it with extra pickles (aside from the two that they USUALLY put on their sandwiches) and was not surprised to see one measly pickle on my singed chicken.

Holly was the cashier who took our order. My wife and I were sitting not too far away from the area that you place your orders at we noticed that Olivia walk from the booth that she was sitting in and got her food probably 2 minutes after placing her order she got her food before ours next we hear employees yelling out for Olivia they were yelling to come back after she was sitting down for a couple of minutes and for her to bring her food with her. I immediately got up and walked to the cashier area and I watched Olivia hand off her sandwich which was in a in chickfila box they told her she grabbed the wrong sandwich I watched the manager pass the sandwich back to the kitchen I asked Holly the cashier if that was my sandwich and if it was I do not want it as it went out to a table and was out there for a few minutes I would like a new sandwich I figured it was mine as there was no one else in the restaurant ordering food. She asked the manager and she said yes it was a grilled chicken sandwich the manager then told the employees in the back they're going to need to make another chicken sandwich I thought this was real tacky as they were going to serve me that sandwich I forgot to mention yes that sandwich along with my wife's sandwich and fries were already on a platter ready to be served to us. I confronted the manager about this she denied all responsibility and just said that she didn't know I told her you did see the employee bring it back to you and hand it to you and you handed it to the back all she kept saying is I'm sorry I didn't know.

(This has been the case on numerous visits.). I knew better than to go to this location, but my husband ordered on his app and chose this location since I was in the area.  I pulled up to the driveway and told the clerk outside that I had an online order.  He said the payment didn't go through..  This is very strange as we order breakfast from the Mayo Blvd location 3-5 times a week and have never had an issue!  Why would the app process the order and let you select ""I'm at the restaurant"" if it didn't go through.  He said there would be no way to refund if it processes twice.  So I drove to the window and spoke to the ""?manager?"" blonde lady.  She kept saying it hasn't been paid for.  I showed her the screenshot from my husband's app showing it took $ off his app..  She Made me pay for it again, handing me a receipt and said if there was a problem come back.  Well there is a problem.  The $ was taken from his app as well as my cc.  This is not about the $8, this is about taking care of your customers.  Not driving them away.  I left a message 4 days ago, no calls back.  My husband went into the restaurant today, was told nothing they will do about this. They will not refund him the $. Close this location down or get a new owner PLEASE.  We love the Chik-fil-A's off Mayo Blvd in Scottsdale & 44th St & Indian School in Phoenix.  Class acts at these 2 locations."

But for some reason this location is always certain in providing me with an unpleasant experience. Be it cold served food or just simply a skinny chicken sandwich. Other locations that I visit much more often have never disappointed. I'm always thrilled about their thick juicy chicken sandwiches and today topped my pot to never visit that location again. I am under the impression that they bread their chicken in stores. Not sure how they breaded a breast as thin as my slice of cheese.

Shocker seeing as how the store is ran by 16 year olds.Not sure I'll ever visit this location again, I've been to a dozen locations and this one by far has the worst service I've come across.

Why, WHY would you, as a manager, be rude and act like you cannot help someone who is having some type of glitch on his mobile chick fil a app.Your employees have always been super nice and I've always appreciated it. To the tall blonde manager, I am extremely disappointed in the way you treated me. As a business owner, I would have gone above and beyond to help you with a problem. I needed and asked for your help on a simple issue. All you had to do was offer a simple solution. Instead you made me never want to return and embarrassed me.  That was so uncharacteristic of why is otherwise an awesome company."

The employees are terribly rude and will try their hardest to avoid doing things. When our food came so did my husband's shake, but it didn't come with a straw. When he asked the old lady who brought out the food if she brought one out, she said no and told him he can get one himself from the front. She didn't say it kindly either. She was short, didn't make eye contact, and started walking away as she answered him. Why bring me my food if you aren't going to bring me the supplies to eat my food? I've never been to a Chick-fil-A where I felt like such an imposition to the workers and it wasn't even a busy time of day. I'd rather she sat down and called our number at the counter so I could have gotten a straw when I went up to get more order rather than when I'm comfortably seated. Halfway through my meal I run out of lemonade -because it's 90% ice- so I went up to the front for more and it took several minutes to get assistance. The line was non-existent, but they were socializing, yelling to each other to coordinate their breaks, or just avoiding eye contact. I finally was able to maintain eye contact with someone and he filled up my cup without saying anything to me other than ""sugar?"". I took it that he was asking if I want the regular lemonade versus diet, so I said ""Yes, please"", then thanked him when he put the filled cup on the counter. As we were getting ready to leave I wanted some more lemonade - again these ""drinks"" are mainly ice so I wasn't getting much lemonade and I'm a breastfeeding mom so I need a lot of liquid anyways. His eyes got huge and he stared at me like I just asked for 20 packs of sauce with my order. I made a joke and said ""I know, I might as well have bought a gallon jug, right?"" because I'm friendly and thought he was trying to be funny, but he just kept staring at me like I was asking way too much of him. Finally he snatched the drink from my hand, filled the cup, and brought it back to me. I put out my hand and rather than giving me the cup, he set it down away from me and turned his back to me so quickly that I couldn't even thank him for refilling my cup. I have never had a restaurant experience where I am significantly more polite to the servers than they are to me. This is not Chick-fil-A, this is a chicken version of [insert cheap fast food restaurant here]. I live 5 minutes away from this location, but I'd rather go down to the Camelback location just to avoid this one. Or I'll just go to In N Out right across the street because I don't want to take the chance that I'm going to get that much attitude when I'm trying to grab a quick meal."

On Nov 8th around 8:30pm, me and my boyfriend went to pick up some dinner after a crappy day, and an even crappier week. All I wanted to sooth my sorry soul, was a spicy chicken sandwich from Chick-fil-A. We placed our order, and pulled through to pay for our food. I had knowingly left my wallet at home. so my boyfriend reached into his pocket to get his. He sighed deeply, and turned to me and said, ""I left my wallet in my backpack at home."" My stomach dropped, and I was pretty crushed, because seriously....all I wanted was a stupid chicken sandwich...So we pull through, and I let a young blonde woman know that we forgot our wallets at home and couldn't pay for the food. She smiled and without missing a beat said, ""Don't worry this one is on us."" No guilt, no second guessing, just no problem and a smile.Touched, we thanked her and pulled up to get our order. Not only did we get our (delicious) food, we also got a few extra of our favorite sauces as a little icing on the cake.You didn't know how stressful our week had been. You didn't know that all I wanted was that chicken sandwich....you were just being kind to a stranger in your drive thru. I want you to know that this stranger really needed, and appreciated it. Young-blonde-woman-who's-name-I-don't-know, thank you for your kindness. And thanks Chick-Fil-A for empowering your employees to show that kind of compassion to your customers.

Second time coming here I wanted to make sure everything was in the bag and they replied so rude as if they wanted us out of there. They weren't packed like the first time we came here. The first time a young man was handling our drinks, thank god we caught how many he gave us because he forgot one, his fault because we witness him conversating with other employees.

When we got up to the pay window the girl informed me that we'd have to pay for the extra sauces (they only give you 2). Ok, no problem. But then she rolls her eyes and gives me the snottiest attitude about it. She says ""yeah, it's because, you know, people like this (me) who order to much sauce"". Ummmm....sayeth what?!

The last three times I have visited (always through the drive-through) the cashier has gotten my order wrong (either something completely wrong, or made incorrectly), even when they say it correctly back to you when you're ordering. The last time I was here I had ordered a milkshake with no cherry as I am allergic to them (which I also said), drove up to the window, and was handed a milkshake with a cherry on it. When I gave it back and let them know it was supposed to no cherry, I watched the cashier through the window pick the cherry out with a napkin and cover up the leftover juice with whipped cream, then give it back to me. After asking if it had been remade, the guy didn't know what to say and didn't answer me until I told him it needed to be remade and I had seen him just pick it out with a napkin. Fast forward two weeks later, my husband and I are at chick-fil-a again, and we order a grilled nugget meal. Pulling up to the window, we are now given a regular (breaded) nugget meal. When we asked about it and gave it back to them, the cashier (who didn't apologize) informed us they would need to charge an additional $0.80 for the price difference. Seriously? So now we're again waiting for several minutes for the correct food after getting the wrong order. The service as this chick-fil-a used to be great, but lately is seems like all of the workers are high school kids wanting to gossip and hang out without paying attention to helping customers or doing their job. Judging from the other recent yelp reviews, we're not the only people this has happened to. The service/management at this store really needs to get it together."

An added bonus is that their lemonade is delicious! The restaurant is usually clean and the service is quick and friendly.

The chicken. It is so juicy and fresh.   Even the breaded entrees are not overshadowed by the hard and crusty layers of breading other ff chains glob on - on efforts to save on the protein. Here you get generous portions, each one delivering taste and freshness. Especially the grilled chicken has a tooth some and juicy flavor.What u love most about the sides? Kiddos get a plethora of fruit in a fruit cup ranging from crisp apples and blueberries to tangy sweet mandarins.The lemonade virtually tastes like a fresh squeezed lemon with simple syrup and I am consumed by how amazing it tastes.The most terrific thing? It is so kid friendly that twice a month they have an hour or so of activities for kids. These include a scavenger hunt or art contests, art projects, face painting, and more. The wow factor is that is is absolutely free.The staff are consistently friendly and engaging, they even bring your order to the table.I come her about twice a month with my girls, my 5 year old asks to go every day!

I found this wonderful jewel of fast food restaurants 6.5 years ago. Lourdes, who is the owner of this franchise has a great store, great staff, and it is always decorated nicely for the upcoming holidays. When you walk in it is warm and inviting. All the other CFAs are boring and all the other fast food restaurants cant compare. They are corporate sterile. No imagination.The restaurant is always clean and the service is excellent. They want everybody to be happy and have a good time. You are treated better than family. If you have occasional problem they will make it right and treat you with respect in QUICK EARTH TIME. You don't have to visit the manager to be berated and called an idiot to get satisfaction. Nor, do you have to wait 15 minutes to get served an ice cream cone like the clown restaurant.Because this restaurant gives stellar service and the food is good I eat here once a day. I know there are a few more customers that frequent this store as much as I do. I am sure they share the same feelings.I thank the owner, Lourdes and her staff for being a part of my life and make feel special.Not many restaurants, fast food or otherwise can exceed the great value and service  this restaurant offers."

They deserve props for inventing the chicken sandwich, for the cute cow commercials and for maintaining their religious principles. That said, I don't really care for this location. It's cramped, with a lot of tables and a children's play area crammed into a very small space. Also, no way to refill your soda on your own. Chick-Fil-A overall is a bit expensive for what it is, perhaps in part a consequence of its closed on Sunday policy.I tried their grilled chicken nuggets a la carte on my recent visit. How disappointing. They came out soggy, sealed in a plastic container, where they had apparently been for quite some time. Gross! Gross! Gross! Definitely no resemblance to the promotional photographs! When I mentioned how disgusting they were to another family member, they immediately asked, ""Did you go at lunchtime?"" ""They make bigger quantities in advance at lunchtime and the food then is never as good."" Hmm. Makes some sense, I guess. Still, over five bucks for six tiny slime covered grilled nuggets and the smallest small sized soft drink I've seen in years, leaves me less than enthusiastic in any case. Plus, call me silly, but I like to eat lunch at lunchtime."

I get there around 6:30 to a FULL drive-thru. After waiting almost 15mins in the drive-thru line alone I get to order and quickly get my food. I pull out of the plaza and stop less than a block away at a red light so I decide to check my food. I clearly noticed I had someone else's order because it was not even close to mine. I make and immediate u-turn and return to the still very long drive-thru line. I finally get to the order speaker and explain what happened. I'm asked to pull up to the window and a very youth and confused teenager tries to make it seem like I'm wrong because that's what I ordered and paid for like it said in the receipt. By now I'm steaming mad and ask for a manager. The manager with plenty of attitude takes the wrong food back and gives me my correct order. I ask her what about the difference between what I paid and what my correct order was because I noticed my correct order was less expensive. I told her I didn't need the change and asked if I could get a brownie to make up the difference they owed me + the hassle. She quickly responded something like ""the brownie is $1.39 and the difference we owe you is only $.38 cents so you will have to pay the difference plus tax."" I was shocked and lost for words at the awful customer service I was getting from one of my favorite fast food places. After a few seconds of feeling like I was going to have a stroke from the anger I finally managed to ask for my $.38 cents back which she quickly gave to me. Since I have yet to eat at any Chick-Fil-Abecause my pride don't let me give a single penny to that company.

While this is true I felt it was worth writing a little snippet for the always refreshing Chick-Fil-A.It's nice to have a fast food experience where the food tastes fresh and actually like real chicken. The nuggets are yummy, flavorful but not overbreaded. My parents enjoyed their chicken sandwiches and agreed that the food is fresh tasting and not too heavy. We also enjoyed the sweet tea which is a classic Chick-fil-A staple.One important thing to note was that this location was super busy when we walked in right at noon but soon after we ordered our food was ready in a flash. And for those of you who have never been to CFA before? The icing on the cake is the wonderful assortment of dipping sauces to suit whatever flavor mood you are in at the moment.

I love the original chicken sandwich; I add 1 pack of honey mustard. I grab a second honey mustard packet for dipping my delicious waffle fries - which, unfortunately, they sometimes skimp on, in my opinion. I have to tell you, though, I witnessed the talent of the best balloon artist I've ever seen at this location! (He's not there every week, but you'll find him there on some Wednesday afternoons for the whole ""kids eat free"" thing.) I was so mesmerized, as I waited in line to order and then for my food,  that I hardly noticed the wait and the fact that the place was overrun with little ones didn't detract from my experience! Chick-fil-a actually caters to the whole family thing really well. (And, their kids' meals have educational toys, often promoting literacy)."

No.  I should have gone to have sushi.the 2 stars are because I WANT it to be more that 1 star. I give it another go ahead, a few weeks later-- at this point I have eaten so many carbs my pant buttons are popping off and AGAIN!  cold fries and soggy bun.  WTF??!!  I haven't been back since and since I am on a NEW diet, I won't be heading there anytime soon.  Boooooooo."

It's usually been a pretty smooth process but today was anything but. The parking lot, drive thru situation was a literal sh#% show. Road rage over people trying to pull their car into the right lane. People were trying to get into drive they line from all directions. Through traffic in the parking lot was completely blocked bu those waiting to get in drive through. After waiting almost 20 minutes or so I got to the window to pick up my order. They said it was not ready and directed me to parking spaces to pull into. Well, there was not a single one available. I had no where to go. Almost got hit by other cars backing out. Finally was told by an employee to go park somewhere else. Parked and waited another almost 10 minutes for my order. Bottom line is the drive thru situation is a nightmare as far as people getting into the line. Cars are trying to enter from multiple spots. People are thinking others are cutting them off. It was just an absolute nightmare. This drive through and parking lot situation needs to be re-designed. I won't be visiting this location anymore.

I recently moved to this area and came here for the first time a few weeks back. Saw the biggest line I have ever seen in a Chick-fil-A. I figured it's because it's very popular around here, and other ppl like me love their menu. But after my third attempt at this place, I realize that the ridiculous lines in this place are not just because of the popularity. It's got to be the staff! The lines move one car every 4-5 minutes. Sometimes more. I turned my car off one time for about 12 minutes because it simply wasn't moving. What sucks is that once in line, it's hard to get out of it after 30 minutes of not even having an order placed, but having 10 cars in front and 10 cars behind. I'm not kidding you. And if you want to see it for yourself, simply drive by and check it out. But do yourself a favor and do not enter that line. For no on, I will drive to any other location even if I have to drive further to not ever be stuck in that absurd line."

It's always a great place to stop by if your looking for great fast food location, and or extremely great chicken. If your a huge fan of fired chicken, or just chicken in general, I would definitely recommend checking out your local Chick-fil-A. They also have one of the best customer services I've ever seen, always being super polite and understanding. The only cons about Chick-fil-A I can think of are that almost every location is always going to be packed with an overwhelming amount of customers at all times, and that it is definitely not the cheapest place to eat at, and for some people that might destroy the whole point of fast food being cheap to get, however besides the pricing and the wait, Chick-fil-A is one of the best fast food establishments out there and I would absolutely recommend eating here sometime."

I realized the line was moving pretty darn fast and decided to stay. All in all, I waited about 15-18 minutes. They have a giant tent set up so part of the line is in the shade.  The order takers are standing outside in this heat, taking orders and ringing you up on the spot where you slide your own cars so no touch transmission possible. Then 3 ordering lines converge into one drive thru pick up line. When you near the window, they have a spot for 3 cars to pull up while 3 servers bring your order to your window, confirm your name for pick up and off you go.

It didn't disappoint.  Smaller than many other stores, the service was still quick, courteous, and the food was Ah-may-zing as always!! There's a kid play area and plenty of seating. This store is located on the fringes of the Target/AMC supercenter at I 17 and the 101.  So it's hard to spot unless you know it's there.  Lots of other eateries are surrounding it.  They had THREE drive-thru lanes going yesterday (which means obviously lots of people know it's there!)The service in particular was outstanding.  The cashiers and expeditors couldn't have been nicer. We polished off the food quickly (we were hungry!) and it was so good!!I'm going to remember  this location for the future.  It's not horribly far from my home - AND they're opening a Deseret Bookstore in that same plaza later this month!!"

When we finally heard our name called, I was so excited. However, I walked up to the counter and my food was gone. I thought, no big deal, but I let the staff know. Apparently someone with a similar name had taken our food. The staff was incredible, so great! They guaranteed to make our food again and get it out as soon as possible. The staff went above and beyond, upgrading our order and apologizing along the way. To top it off the staff was very funny and was able to play along as we were joking about the mishap. I wish I got their names so I can call them out specifically, but as a staff they were great!! (Shoutout to the young gentleman in the black shirt because he was the best) 10/10 recommend, they should all get raises, they were great."

First things first, our food was left up at the counter and we were never notified it was finished so it sat up there (past times, actually all times our food has been delivered to our table, what else is that table marker they give you used for) then Ishmael one of the managers was so impolite. Started off with whistling the entire time which to me is not professional especially when people are eating and when it's brought up should be stopped. Than Ishmael decided to talk about all his personal issues at the table behind us, in which I had to turn around and ask him if he could take the conversation elsewhere as it was so inappropriate. Another manager named Emily was there as well, in which I asked her if she really allows this to happen. Be accountable and if your other manager can't figure it out, she should've. Emily also had the audacity to ask me what the issue was in regards to Ishmael and his inappropriate behavior. I am so disappointed in the service that was received. So inappropriate and unprofessional especially coming from chick   Fil a where being polite and professional is so highly valued by your company. I look forward to hearing from you."

They thought it was user error so the person checked my app and saw that i did everything correct. They then told me that the app has issues a lot and told me to go to next agent for more assistance. Long story short they kicked me down the road to two more agents and problem did not get resolved. In the end i got no rewards and no points for my meal. I couldnt even add my points back because the kept the receipt. I have contacted management multiple times and finally got a reply. They said they will give me a 8 ct and told me to call corporate to get my points. I called corporate and they said the store does it. I am getting kicked back and fourth with no answers. And 2nd time around i have called and left messages to the manager and he did not answer or call me back after i have left him multiple messages.. this chi fil a is poorly managed and takes no responsibility because they are franchisee.

I've always felt that you get very little bang for your buck here and honestly I don't get that super friendly service they are always preaching about on TV. A few months ago I order for my office.

The food was fine like it always is, the employees and service are what have made it terrible. Saying the employees are slow is an understatement. I stood there for 5 minutes waiting on a refill, the person bagging the food usually helps with refills but today she just stared at me as I patiently waited. The employee on the register was with people but after he completed their order he came around the counter to bring them their drink and talk to another employee 5 feet away from me as I waited. The other person on register took another customer to order instead of getting my drink, finally after a couple minutes of conversing the original person came back to the register but instead of helping me when he looked at me him and the other employee continued to talk, well when the second employee left I thought i was finally gonna get a refill but instead he took on the next customer who was an employee coming to get food before his shift, so I walked up to the counter and set my drink down and then he finally asked if I needed a refill, took everything I had not to reply with, no I'm just standing here with the lid off of my cup for fun. So even slower than when I ordered my drink he filled it up not saying a word. I ordered my food from the same guy and he was lacking any personality, couldn't speak up, I've never seen anyone press buttons slower and to say that the new employees move slow, is a great understatement. After watching the employees the last few times I have come in I can only compare the speed they move at to frozen molasses. They don't greet anyone with a smile, if you're lucky enough to be greeted, they don't have any personality at all, he made me and my girlfriend feel uncomfortable while we ordered because of the lack of personality. The only reason I still go to this chick fil a is because it's the closest one to my house and the food is still good, but the other week I drive to flagstaff just for chick fil a and that visit reminded me how amazing chick fil a is.

551,/biz/chick-fil-a-phoenix-2?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Phoenix,1 star rating,7/10/2018,Went into this location today and I was really disappointed in the customer service. Walking in I wasn't greeted and an employee ran into me as I was walking in and didn't even apologize or recognize I was walking. The workers were rude and inattentive. The cashier seemed like she didn't want to even be here and had attitude. I understand most of the workers are young but that doesn't mean they can't have manners. Really disappointed as I know Chick-fil-A is usually very polite and has great customer service. I definitely will not be coming into this branch again.

Two nights ago we went to have a late dinner and I was beyond shock how rude she disrespectful our cashier was to my daughter and I.... normally after I order you guys read our order back but this was the first it didn't happen. All I said was did you get the extra large fries with no salt and she said no and I said then can you add it please but Omgosh that became such a huge deal and she kept on saying I never ordered it which I did plus my daughter had said it too .... long story short she wasn't having it at all she was sooo rude so disrespectful that I got upset and ask for a manager ... team leader came! and was on her side and didn't care , I just told them I have never dealt with this kind of nonsense anywhere especially here ( you guys are the best Customer Service anywhere but not after that night. I ask for my money back and left peacefully while all 3 workers stared rudely like they won something! This is my second Yelp, my first one was to give a new restaurant a 5 star so this is something I never do but was so upset about over a order that shouldn't have been a big deal so yes I had to come on here and write a review!"

I went to this one this morning and we picked up food for 3.

I literally downloaded Yelp just to write this.  I went to this Chick-Fil-A earlier and was pretty surprised went they told me my card got declined. I told them I would be right back and drove away leaving no explanation really. After leaving thru their drive thru  I realized that they had already given me our drinks.. I called back after 5 minutes and told them that I was sorry that I drove away not realizing I already got the drinks and that I was just calling the bank to see why my card got declined. They said not to worry and they understand and I told them That I was on my way back. When I got to the window they said that because I was honest and called about the drinks that they would take care of the order and I didn't have to pay for it. My heart seriously melted ..not because of the money but because of the act of kindness from these 2 specific girls (I should have gotten their name.) it was seriously the nicest thing that has happened to me in a long time. Just the thought of doing something so sweet and nice left such an impression on me. We have always been a fan of this restaurant but now I'm a greater fan. Thank you for having such amazing customer service ...most drive thru's can't wait to throw the food at you with no smile at all. You're employees have always left such a positive impression even before today. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Slightly over cooked noodles, but cheesy. Fruit cup side is spectacular! Not a bowl of melons  strawberry's, blueberry, mandarin oranges, and two kinds of apples. Fantastic!The pinnacle food here is the chicken soup. Best chicken soup bar none. Excellent chicken flavor, meaty, and superb broth. The best chicken soup anywhere. I also like the foam cups for drinks - keeps them cool. Staff is friendly and helpful. Seating is clean, comfortable and better quality than typical fast food."

I love getting the Chick-fil-a deluxe(it comes with lettuce & tomatoe) the original comes with just pickles on it. If you get a kids meal you can trade your toy for ice cream.

Let's start with the price of a pressed chicken sandwich with nothing else. $4.01. Now, the taste, was prepared before ordering and only warm when served. I realize a lot of people like this place, but if I want a chicken sandwich that is made when I order it and doesn't taste like it was cut from a roll of processed chicken then I will try Wendy's or Jack in the Box next time.

We never order biscuits on Monday because they are dried out and hard. Then there was a time the bagels were so hard you could knock on wood with them. The people seem nice - so not sure if this a training issue or lack of caring. Oh and if you order hash browns - be prepared to get anywhere from 9-15 of them.  Sigh I guess @mcdonalds is our alternative-at least the orders are right and consistent."

I found evidence to this claim this morning at the Chick-fil-A at Deer Valley (I-17 & 101). Of course I've never had bad service at any of the Chick-fil-A's I've dined at. But the customer experience this morning was exceptional enough for me to lift my ban of chain restaurants.I would guess that the number one complaint or reason for giving a bad Yelp! review stems from bad service. Having worked in the industry more than a few times, I notice these things. So when I see someone (or a whole lotta someones) doing their job at what I consider an ""old-fashioned level"", I want them to know it was appreciated.This morning, while in the area, I stopped in for breakfast at what I thought might be a healthier alternative to standard industry fare. I was right! The Egg White Grill was delicious, not to mention under 500 calories. And who knew the coffee at Chick-fil-A was this good? But the great food here is only a part of this review.The couple ahead of me in line got into an argument at the register, but the cashier kept her composure and continued like nothing happened (and you wonder why you get bad service!) and smiled the whole time. And the cashier who took my order (Johnna) was very pleasant, helpful and also smiled the whole time. They aren't fake smiles either. You can hear how genuinely friendly the employees are in their voices.This Chick-fil-A is a little difficult to get to unless you're already in this shopping center, but it's worth your time if you want an alternative to the zombies that are hired at nearly every other fast food restaurant.

For some reason management thinks a live person in a kiosk, handing out menus and chatting up each customer is faster than just driving up to the menu sign and placing an order.  If the queue time averages 4.5 minutes per car, during a lunch rush with 7 cars in line is about a 30 minute ordeal to order and receive your food.  Ridiculous!"

So I took it to an employee and she threw it away and got us a new one and it looked Aracely the same so I went up to the counter and the  lady went to the back and came out and said that they change their oil every month well that's disgusting!! You should be changing it way earlier than that. Like 2 weeks at least. I'm going to send in a complaint

I keep coming back for the flavorful food and to be ""served"" by their fabulous staff (as they say in the drive thru: ""How may I serve you?""). My husband and I were visiting from NorCal and headed to PHX airport from the Grand Canyon. This location was about 1 mile off the freeway and the line was very quick (just one window where you pay and get your food). At first the line was really long and we could hear the lady a few cars in front of us asking very detailed questions about what the menu offered. I was impressed that the staff person taking the order was so patient and gave a friendly, customary ""my pleasure"" at the end of the exchange. If you've never been to Chick-fil-A, try the waffle fries and a regular chicken sandwich - and then come back and explore all the other quality options! On the original sandwich, the chicken is very moist and the bread is soft. The only decor is a couple pickles! We also tried the iced lemonade drink - a sweet blend of their ice cream and lemonade (think lemonade shake). Unreal!Overall, I appreciate the consistent taste and  friendly service this chain provides, no matter where I am in the US! (The only thing is: don't crave Chick-fil-A on Sunday, as you will be sorely disappointed!)"

The staff was super slow despite the fact they were really busy and only had 1 register open but all kinds of people walking around back there.  I saw a shift leader just stand there for 10 min waiting for his own food but offering no assurance to anyone else.

The gilled chicken sandwich was tender and overall delicious. I am a little embarrassed that it took me so long to try this place.

I hadn't eaten Chick-fil-A since it was on my college campus years ago, but I went along anyway. UGH. I guess this constitutes as ""good"" food if you grew up in a trailer, but otherwise...pass. 1) The chicken always has a weird strip on the end that makes me wonder what exactly it is. It's chewy and disgusting and I remember cutting it off every time I ate CFA in Flagstaff. 2) In true trailer park fashion, everyone has their dirty, loud, screaming children with them and let them run wild, usually barefoot or with a dirty diaper sagging two inches from the floor.

They have the best chicken sandwiches on the planet, and they must know it since it is 50% of their menu. I don't particularly like chicken sandwiches, but the ones they make are incredible. Don't forget the buffalo sauce.Atmosphere and Staff:Inside is always clean, and the decor is comfy.  They keep the AC around 70-72 degrees and some might find it a bit chilly.

First of all it is right across the street from where i work and they are always giving away free food...via your receipt or sending out discount coupons. They make the best chicken sandwich on earth...i am not kidding. It is the first real chicken breast sandwich i ever seen served at a fast food restaurant. It is a little more expensive than your average chicken sandwich but it is definitely worth it. It is not open on Sunday's because it is a Christian Franchise so they let their employee's have Sunday's off. This particular location has great customer service...fast service...it is extremely clean and all the food is great no matter what you choose. The dessert is not half bad either...so if you ever want the best chicken sandwich you have ever had in your life please go to Chick-fil-A. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"

666,/biz/chick-fil-a-phoenix-2?osq=Chick-fil-A,Chick-fil-A,Phoenix,4 star rating,7/29/2009,"Boo for Chick-fil-A closing the Ghettrocenter location, which was closer, but yea for this location for being so much closer than Arrowhead.Come to think of it, this location was quicker and more efficient than Arrowhead, resulting in hotter, fresher food.  Yea for Deer Valley Chick-fil-A.My lunch hour drive thru order was ready before I was with the cash, meaning the chicken's precooked, but they still had to slap it together, since I got the lettuce and tomato.  All the food was fresh; nice generous portion of green leaf lettuce, good-as-can-be-expected tomato (2 slices), and the waffle fries were in the exact correct place on the delicate Greasy-Crispy Spectrum.The two clerks I interacted with were friendly and it even seemed genuine.  Sure Chick-fil-A is not as cheap as other fast food choices, but it's so much better feeling the clear juice of a real chicken breast run down your hand than the mucky slippery oil from a chopped & formed chicken 'patty' that a lot of places have. (Exactly what part of the chicken is the 'patty', anyway?)Churchies own all their places, so they are oh so annoyingly closed on Sundays as a rule.  But the food is so good that any effort to protest them by not going the rest of the week would be short-lived.  Now if they ever started in-store proselytizing, that'd be a different story, but they've never done that, far as I can tell.When I go in, I get the Ice Dream; exactly what part of the cow that is, I do not know, but it's sad to think they get those cows' hopes up by making them stooges for their ""EAT MORE CHIKN"" mock-protest marketing campaign, only to steal their dreams from them one way or another, and freeze them up for a tasty frozen dessert.  I picture a dark and gloomy torture room, probably the basement of one of their churches, where cows are strapped up and sucked of their dreams,  like the hapless folk from the Dark Crystal having their 'essence' drained by the Skeksies.  Or maybe that's how they get the fresh lemonade?"
